        "appname" is the name of application.
            If None, just the system directory is returned.
        "appauthor" (only used on Windows) is the name of the
            appauthor or distributing body for this application. Typically
            it is the owning company name. This falls back to appname. You may
            pass False to disable it.
        "version" is an optional version path element to append to the
            path. You might want to use this if you want multiple versions
            of your app to be able to run independently. If used, this
            would typically be "<major>.<minor>".
            Only applied when appname is present.
        "opinion" (boolean) can be False to disable the appending of
            "Cache" to the base app data dir for Windows. See
            discussion below.

    Typical user cache directories are:
        Mac OS X:   ~/Library/Caches/<AppName>
        Unix:       ~/.cache/<AppName> (XDG default)
        Win XP:     C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Local Settings\Application Data\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>\Cache
        Vista:      C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>\Cache

    On Windows the only suggestion in the MSDN docs is that local settings go in
    the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA` directory. This is identical to the non-roaming
    app data dir (the default returned by `user_data_dir` above). Apps typically
    put cache data somewhere *under* the given dir here. Some examples:
        ...\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<ProfileName>\Cache
        ...\Acme\SuperApp\Cache\1.0
    OPINION: This function appends "Cache" to the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA` value.
    This can be disabled with the `opinion=False` option.
    Return full path to the user-specific log dir for this application.

        "appname" is the name of application.
            If None, just the system directory is returned.
        "appauthor" (only used on Windows) is the name of the
            appauthor or distributing body for this application. Typically
            it is the owning company name. This falls back to appname. You may
            pass False to disable it.
        "version" is an optional version path element to append to the
            path. You might want to use this if you want multiple versions
            of your app to be able to run independently. If used, this
            would typically be "<major>.<minor>".
            Only applied when appname is present.
        "opinion" (boolean) can be False to disable the appending of
            "Logs" to the base app data dir for Windows, and "log" to the
            base cache dir for Unix. See discussion below.

    Typical user log directories are:
        Mac OS X:   ~/Library/Logs/<AppName>
        Unix:       ~/.cache/<AppName>/log  # or under $XDG_CACHE_HOME if defined
        Win XP:     C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Local Settings\Application Data\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>\Logs
        Vista:      C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>\Logs

    On Windows the only suggestion in the MSDN docs is that local settings
    go in the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA` directory. (Note: I'm interested in
    examples of what some windows apps use for a logs dir.)

    OPINION: This function appends "Logs" to the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA`
    value for Windows and appends "log" to the user cache dir for Unix.
    This can be disabled with the `opinion=False` option.

            Only applied when appname is present.
        "roaming" (boolean, default False) can be set True to use the Windows
            roaming appdata directory. That means that for users on a Windows
            network setup for roaming profiles, this user data will be
            sync'd on login. See

        Quick sanity checks for common bugs caused by environment.
        There are some cases e.g. with wrong BLAS ABI that cause wrong
        results under specific runtime conditions that are not necessarily
        achieved during test suite runs, and it is useful to catch those early.

        See https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/8577 and other
        similar bug reports.

        
NumPy
=====

Provides
  1. An array object of arbitrary homogeneous items
  2. Fast mathematical operations over arrays
  3. Linear Algebra, Fourier Transforms, Random Number Generation

How to use the documentation
----------------------------
Documentation is available in two forms: docstrings provided
with the code, and a loose standing reference guide, available from
`the NumPy homepage <https://www.scipy.org>`_.

We recommend exploring the docstrings using
`IPython <https://ipython.org>`_, an advanced Python shell with
TAB-completion and introspection capabilities.  See below for further
instructions.

The docstring examples assume that `numpy` has been imported as `np`::

  >>> import numpy as np

Code snippets are indicated by three greater-than signs::

  >>> x = 42
  >>> x = x + 1

Use the built-in ``help`` function to view a function's docstring::

  >>> help(np.sort)
  ... # doctest: +SKIP

For some objects, ``np.info(obj)`` may provide additional help.  This is
particularly true if you see the line "Help on ufunc object:" at the top
of the help() page.  Ufuncs are implemented in C, not Python, for speed.
The native Python help() does not know how to view their help, but our
np.info() function does.

To search for documents containing a keyword, do::

  >>> np.lookfor('keyword')
  ... # doctest: +SKIP

General-purpose documents like a glossary and help on the basic concepts
of numpy are available under the ``doc`` sub-module::

  >>> from numpy import doc
  >>> help(doc)
  ... # doctest: +SKIP

__version__
    NumPy version string

Viewing documentation using IPython
-----------------------------------
Start IPython with the NumPy profile (``ipython -p numpy``), which will
import `numpy` under the alias `np`.  Then, use the ``cpaste`` command to
paste examples into the shell.  To see which functions are available in
`numpy`, type ``np.<TAB>`` (where ``<TAB>`` refers to the TAB key), or use
``np.*cos*?<ENTER>`` (where ``<ENTER>`` refers to the ENTER key) to narrow
down the list.  To view the docstring for a function, use
``np.cos?<ENTER>`` (to view the docstring) and ``np.cos??<ENTER>`` (to view
the source code).

Copies vs. in-place operation
-----------------------------
Most of the functions in `numpy` return a copy of the array argument
(e.g., `np.sort`).  In-place versions of these functions are often
available as array methods, i.e. ``x = np.array([1,2,3]); x.sort()``.
Exceptions to this rule are documented.

...  Distributor init file

Distributors: you can add custom code here to support particular distributions
of numpy.

For example, this is a good place to put any checks for hardware requirements.

The numpy standard source distribution will not put code in this file, so you
can safely replace this file with your own version.
numpy._distributor_init/home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/_distributor_init.py<module numpy._distributor_init><module numpy._globals>/home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/_globals.py_is_loaded
Module defining global singleton classes.

This module raises a RuntimeError if an attempt to reload it is made. In that
way the identities of the classes defined here are fixed and will remain so
even if numpy itself is reloaded. In particular, a function like the following
will still work correctly after numpy is reloaded::

    def foo(arg=np._NoValue):
        if arg is np._NoValue:
            ...

That was not the case when the singleton classes were defined in the numpy
``__init__.py`` file. See gh-7844 for a discussion of the reload problem that
motivated this module.

_NoValueType.__reduce___NoValueType__instance_NoValueType.__new__Visible deprecation warning.

    By default, python will not show deprecation warnings, so this class
    can be used when a very visible warning is helpful, for example because
    the usage is most likely a user bug.

    Reloading numpy._globals is not allowedSpecial keyword value.

    The instance of this class may be used as the default value assigned to a
    deprecated keyword in order to check if it has been given a user defined
    value.
    <no value>Module deprecation warning.

    The nose tester turns ordinary Deprecation warnings into test failures.
    That makes it hard to deprecate whole modules, because they get
    imported by default. So this is a special Deprecation warning that the
    nose tester will let pass without making tests fail.

    __ALL___NoValueType.__repr__--cov=-W ignore:in 3\.x, __setslice__:DeprecationWarning-W ignore:buffer\(\) not supported in 3\.x:DeprecationWarning-l
    Pytest test runner.

    This class is made available in ``numpy.testing``, and a test function
    is typically added to a package's __init__.py like so::

      from numpy.testing import PytestTester
      test = PytestTester(__name__).test
      del PytestTester

    Calling this test function finds and runs all tests associated with the
    module and all its sub-modules.

    Attributes
    ----------
    module_name : str
        Full path to the package to test.

    Parameters
    ----------
    module_name : module name
        The name of the module to test.

    -W ignore:Not importing directory--durations=%s-W ignore::UserWarning:cpuinforelaxed_stridescoveragenumpy.distutils-W ignore:in 3\.x, __getslice__:DeprecationWarningfast-W ignore:CObject type is not supported in 3\.x:DeprecationWarninglabelmodule_path
Pytest test running.

This module implements the ``test()`` function for NumPy modules. The usual
boiler plate for doing that is to put the following in the module
``__init__.py`` file::

    from numpy._pytesttester import PytestTester
    test = PytestTester(__name__).test
    del PytestTester


Warnings filtering and other runtime settings should be dealt with in the
``pytest.ini`` file in the numpy repo root. The behavior of the test depends on
whether or not that file is found as follows:

* ``pytest.ini`` is present (develop mode)
    All warnings except those explicily filtered out are raised as error.
* ``pytest.ini`` is absent (release mode)
    DeprecationWarnings and PendingDeprecationWarnings are ignored, other
    warnings are passed through.

In practice, tests run from the numpy repo are run in develop mode. That
includes the standard ``python runtests.py`` invocation.

This module is imported by every numpy subpackage, so lies at the top level to
simplify circular import issues. For the same reason, it contains no numpy
imports at module scope, instead importing numpy within function calls.

        Notes
        -----
        Each NumPy module exposes `test` in its namespace to run all tests for
        it. For example, to run all tests for numpy.lib:

        >>> np.lib.test() #doctest: +SKIP

        Examples
        --------
        >>> result = np.lib.test() #doctest: +SKIP

Compatibility module.

This module contains duplicated code from Python itself or 3rd party
extensions, which may be included for the following reasons:

  * compatibility
  * we may only need a small subset of the copied library/module

tuple function arguments are not supportedFunctionType<module numpy.compat._inspect>**varkwformatargformatvarargsformatvarkwformatvaluespecsgetargsGet information about the arguments accepted by a code object.

    Subset of inspect module from upstream python

We use this instead of upstream because upstream inspect is slow to import, and
significantly contributes to numpy import times. Importing this copy has almost
no overhead.

IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE!

Importing the multiarray numpy extension module failed.  Most
likely you are trying to import a failed build of numpy.
Here is how to proceed:
- If you're working with a numpy git repository, try `git clean -xdf`
  (removes all files not under version control) and rebuild numpy.
- If you are simply trying to use the numpy version that you have installed:
  your installation is broken - please reinstall numpy.
- If you have already reinstalled and that did not fix the problem, then:
  1. Check that you are using the Python you expect (you're using %s),
     and that you have no directories in your PATH or PYTHONPATH that can
     interfere with the Python and numpy versions you're trying to use.
  2. If (1) looks fine, you can open a new issue at
     https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues.  Please include details on:
     - how you installed Python
     - how you installed numpy
     - your operating system
     - whether or not you have multiple versions of Python installed
     - if you built from source, your compiler versions and ideally a build log

     Note: this error has many possible causes, so please don't comment on
     an existing issue about this - open a new one instead.

Original error was: %s
einsumfuncSomething is wrong with the numpy installation. While importing we detected an older version of numpy in {}. One method of fixing this is to repeatedly uninstall numpy until none is found, then reinstall this version.loaded more than 1 DLL from .libs:

    reset()

    Reset the broadcasted result's iterator(s).

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> y = np.array([[4], [5], [6]]
    >>> b = np.broadcast(x, y)
    >>> b.index
    0
    >>> b.next(), b.next(), b.next()

    >>> b.reset()
    >>> b.index

    a.item(*args)

    Copy an element of an array to a standard Python scalar and return it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    \*args : Arguments (variable number and type)

        * none: in this case, the method only works for arrays
          with one element (`a.size == 1`), which element is
          copied into a standard Python scalar object and returned.

        * int_type: this argument is interpreted as a flat index into
          the array, specifying which element to copy and return.

        * tuple of int_types: functions as does a single int_type argument,
          except that the argument is interpreted as an nd-index into the
          array.

    Returns
    -------
    z : Standard Python scalar object
        A copy of the specified element of the array as a suitable
        Python scalar

    Notes
    -----
    When the data type of `a` is longdouble or clongdouble, item() returns
    a scalar array object because there is no available Python scalar that
    would not lose information. Void arrays return a buffer object for item(),
    unless fields are defined, in which case a tuple is returned.

    `item` is very similar to a[args], except, instead of an array scalar,
    a standard Python scalar is returned. This can be useful for speeding up
    access to elements of the array and doing arithmetic on elements of the
    array using Python's optimized math.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.random.randint(9, size=(3, 3))
    >>> x
    array([[3, 1, 7],
           [2, 8, 3],
           [8, 5, 3]])
    >>> x.item(3)
    2
    >>> x.item(7)
    5
    >>> x.item((0, 1))
    1
    >>> x.item((2, 2))
    3

    A copy of the holiday array indicating additional invalid days.
    fromstring(string, dtype=float, count=-1, sep='')

    A new 1-D array initialized from text data in a string.

    Parameters
    ----------
    string : str
        A string containing the data.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The data type of the array; default: float.  For binary input data,
        the data must be in exactly this format.
    count : int, optional
        Read this number of `dtype` elements from the data.  If this is
        negative (the default), the count will be determined from the
        length of the data.
    sep : str, optional
        The string separating numbers in the data; extra whitespace between
        elements is also ignored.

        .. deprecated:: 1.14
            If this argument is not provided, `fromstring` falls back on the
            behaviour of `frombuffer` after encoding unicode string inputs as
            either utf-8 (python 3), or the default encoding (python 2).

    Returns
    -------
    arr : ndarray
        The constructed array.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the string is not the correct size to satisfy the requested
        `dtype` and `count`.

    See Also
    --------
    frombuffer, fromfile, fromiter

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.fromstring('1 2', dtype=int, sep=' ')
    array([1, 2])
    >>> np.fromstring('1, 2', dtype=int, sep=',')
    array([1, 2])

    iternext
    iternext()

    Check whether iterations are left, and perform a single internal iteration
    without returning the result.  Used in the C-style pattern do-while
    pattern.  For an example, see `nditer`.

    Returns
    -------
    iternext : bool
        Whether or not there are iterations left.

    
    a.cumprod(axis=None, dtype=None, out=None)

    Return the cumulative product of the elements along the given axis.

    Refer to `numpy.cumprod` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.cumprod : equivalent function

    
    fromiter(iterable, dtype, count=-1)

    Create a new 1-dimensional array from an iterable object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    iterable : iterable object
        An iterable object providing data for the array.
    dtype : data-type
        The data-type of the returned array.
    count : int, optional
        The number of items to read from *iterable*.  The default is -1,
        which means all data is read.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The output array.

    Notes
    -----
    Specify `count` to improve performance.  It allows ``fromiter`` to
    pre-allocate the output array, instead of resizing it on demand.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> iterable = (x*x for x in range(5))
    >>> np.fromiter(iterable, float)
    array([  0.,   1.,   4.,   9.,  16.])

    arr.newbyteorder(new_order='S')

    Return the array with the same data viewed with a different byte order.

    Equivalent to::

        arr.view(arr.dtype.newbytorder(new_order))

    Changes are also made in all fields and sub-arrays of the array data
    type.



    Parameters
    ----------
    new_order : string, optional
        Byte order to force; a value from the byte order specifications
        below. `new_order` codes can be any of:

        * 'S' - swap dtype from current to opposite endian
        * {'<', 'L'} - little endian
        * {'>', 'B'} - big endian
        * {'=', 'N'} - native order
        * {'|', 'I'} - ignore (no change to byte order)

        The default value ('S') results in swapping the current
        byte order. The code does a case-insensitive check on the first
        letter of `new_order` for the alternatives above.  For example,
        any of 'B' or 'b' or 'biggish' are valid to specify big-endian.


    Returns
    -------
    new_arr : array
        New array object with the dtype reflecting given change to the
        byte order.

    
    Information about the memory layout of the array.

    Attributes
    ----------
    C_CONTIGUOUS (C)
        The data is in a single, C-style contiguous segment.
    F_CONTIGUOUS (F)
        The data is in a single, Fortran-style contiguous segment.
    OWNDATA (O)
        The array owns the memory it uses or borrows it from another object.
    WRITEABLE (W)
        The data area can be written to.  Setting this to False locks
        the data, making it read-only.  A view (slice, etc.) inherits WRITEABLE
        from its base array at creation time, but a view of a writeable
        array may be subsequently locked while the base array remains writeable.
        (The opposite is not true, in that a view of a locked array may not
        be made writeable.  However, currently, locking a base object does not
        lock any views that already reference it, so under that circumstance it
        is possible to alter the contents of a locked array via a previously
        created writeable view onto it.)  Attempting to change a non-writeable
        array raises a RuntimeError exception.
    ALIGNED (A)
        The data and all elements are aligned appropriately for the hardware.
    WRITEBACKIFCOPY (X)
        This array is a copy of some other array. The C-API function
        PyArray_ResolveWritebackIfCopy must be called before deallocating
        to the base array will be updated with the contents of this array.
    UPDATEIFCOPY (U)
        (Deprecated, use WRITEBACKIFCOPY) This array is a copy of some other array.
        When this array is
        deallocated, the base array will be updated with the contents of
        this array.
    FNC
        F_CONTIGUOUS and not C_CONTIGUOUS.
    FORC
        F_CONTIGUOUS or C_CONTIGUOUS (one-segment test).
    BEHAVED (B)
        ALIGNED and WRITEABLE.
    CARRAY (CA)
        BEHAVED and C_CONTIGUOUS.
    FARRAY (FA)
        BEHAVED and F_CONTIGUOUS and not C_CONTIGUOUS.

    Notes
    -----
    The `flags` object can be accessed dictionary-like (as in ``a.flags['WRITEABLE']``),
    or by using lowercased attribute names (as in ``a.flags.writeable``). Short flag
    names are only supported in dictionary access.

    Only the WRITEBACKIFCOPY, UPDATEIFCOPY, WRITEABLE, and ALIGNED flags can be
    changed by the user, via direct assignment to the attribute or dictionary
    entry, or by calling `ndarray.setflags`.

    The array flags cannot be set arbitrarily:

    - UPDATEIFCOPY can only be set ``False``.
    - WRITEBACKIFCOPY can only be set ``False``.
    - ALIGNED can only be set ``True`` if the data is truly aligned.
    - WRITEABLE can only be set ``True`` if the array owns its own memory
      or the ultimate owner of the memory exposes a writeable buffer
      interface or is a string.

    Arrays can be both C-style and Fortran-style contiguous simultaneously.
    This is clear for 1-dimensional arrays, but can also be true for higher
    dimensional arrays.

    Even for contiguous arrays a stride for a given dimension
    ``arr.strides[dim]`` may be *arbitrary* if ``arr.shape[dim] == 1``
    or the array has no elements.
    It does *not* generally hold that ``self.strides[-1] == self.itemsize``
    for C-style contiguous arrays or ``self.strides[0] == self.itemsize`` for
    Fortran-style contiguous arrays is true.
    
    The imaginary part of the array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.sqrt([1+0j, 0+1j])
    >>> x.imag

    bytes into the field.

    Parameters
    ----------
    val : object
        Value to be placed in field.

    The number of outputs.

    Data attribute containing the number of arguments the ufunc treats as output.

    Notes
    -----
    Since all ufuncs can take output arguments, this will always be (at least) 1.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.add.nout
    1

    1
    >>> np.power.nout
    1
    >>> np.exp.nout

    Refer to `numpy.mean` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.mean : equivalent function

    
    The real part of the array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.sqrt([1+0j, 0+1j])
    >>> x.real
    array([ 1.        ,  0.70710678])

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.real : equivalent function

    
    array(object, dtype=None, copy=True, order='K', subok=False, ndmin=0)

    Create an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    object : array_like
        An array, any object exposing the array interface, an object whose
        __array__ method returns an array, or any (nested) sequence.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The desired data-type for the array.  If not given, then the type will
        be determined as the minimum type required to hold the objects in the
        sequence.  This argument can only be used to 'upcast' the array.  For
        downcasting, use the .astype(t) method.
    copy : bool, optional
        If true (default), then the object is copied.  Otherwise, a copy will
        only be made if __array__ returns a copy, if obj is a nested sequence,
        or if a copy is needed to satisfy any of the other requirements
        (`dtype`, `order`, etc.).
    order : {'K', 'A', 'C', 'F'}, optional
        Specify the memory layout of the array. If object is not an array, the
        newly created array will be in C order (row major) unless 'F' is
        specified, in which case it will be in Fortran order (column major).
        If object is an array the following holds.

        ===== ========= ===================================================
        order  no copy                     copy=True
        ===== ========= ===================================================
        'K'   unchanged F & C order preserved, otherwise most similar order
        'A'   unchanged F order if input is F and not C, otherwise C order
        'C'   C order   C order
        'F'   F order   F order
        ===== ========= ===================================================

        When ``copy=False`` and a copy is made for other reasons, the result is
        the same as if ``copy=True``, with some exceptions for `A`, see the
        Notes section. The default order is 'K'.
    subok : bool, optional
        If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise
        the returned array will be forced to be a base-class array (default).
    ndmin : int, optional
        Specifies the minimum number of dimensions that the resulting
        array should have.  Ones will be pre-pended to the shape as
        needed to meet this requirement.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        An array object satisfying the specified requirements.

    See Also
    --------
    empty_like : Return an empty array with shape and type of input.
    ones_like : Return an array of ones with shape and type of input.
    zeros_like : Return an array of zeros with shape and type of input.
    full_like : Return a new array with shape of input filled with value.
    empty : Return a new uninitialized array.
    ones : Return a new array setting values to one.
    zeros : Return a new array setting values to zero.
    full : Return a new array of given shape filled with value.


    Notes
    -----
    When order is 'A' and `object` is an array in neither 'C' nor 'F' order,
    and a copy is forced by a change in dtype, then the order of the result is
    not necessarily 'C' as expected. This is likely a bug.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.array([1, 2, 3])
    array([1, 2, 3])

    Upcasting:

    >>> np.array([1, 2, 3.0])
    array([ 1.,  2.,  3.])

    More than one dimension:

    >>> np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4]])

    Minimum dimensions 2:

    >>> np.array([1, 2, 3], ndmin=2)
    array([[1, 2, 3]])

    Type provided:

    >>> np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=complex)
    array([ 1.+0.j,  2.+0.j,  3.+0.j])

    Data-type consisting of more than one element:

    >>> x = np.array([(1,2),(3,4)],dtype=[('a','<i4'),('b','<i4')])
    >>> x['a']
    array([1, 3])

    Creating an array from sub-classes:

    >>> np.array(np.mat('1 2; 3 4'))
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4]])

    >>> np.array(np.mat('1 2; 3 4'), subok=True)
    matrix([[1, 2],
            [3, 4]])

    
    A reference to the array that is iterated over.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(5)
    >>> fl = x.flat
    >>> fl.base is x
    True

    
    a.take(indices, axis=None, out=None, mode='raise')

    Return an array formed from the elements of `a` at the given indices.

    Refer to `numpy.take` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.take : equivalent function

    a.__copy__()

    Used if :func:`copy.copy` is called on an array. Returns a copy of the array.

    Equivalent to ``a.copy(order='K')``.

    
    busdaycalendar(weekmask='1111100', holidays=None)

    A business day calendar object that efficiently stores information
    defining valid days for the busday family of functions.

    The default valid days are Monday through Friday ("business days").
    A busdaycalendar object can be specified with any set of weekly
    valid days, plus an optional "holiday" dates that always will be invalid.

    Once a busdaycalendar object is created, the weekmask and holidays
    cannot be modified.

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    weekmask : str or array_like of bool, optional
        A seven-element array indicating which of Monday through Sunday are
        valid days. May be specified as a length-seven list or array, like
        [1,1,1,1,1,0,0]; a length-seven string, like '1111100'; or a string
        like "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri", made up of 3-character abbreviations for
        weekdays, optionally separated by white space. Valid abbreviations
        are: Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun
    holidays : array_like of datetime64[D], optional
        An array of dates to consider as invalid dates, no matter which
        weekday they fall upon.  Holiday dates may be specified in any
        order, and NaT (not-a-time) dates are ignored.  This list is
        saved in a normalized form that is suited for fast calculations
        of valid days.

    Returns
    -------
    out : busdaycalendar
        A business day calendar object containing the specified
        weekmask and holidays values.

    See Also
    --------
    is_busday : Returns a boolean array indicating valid days.
    busday_offset : Applies an offset counted in valid days.
    busday_count : Counts how many valid days are in a half-open date range.

    Attributes
    ----------
    Note: once a busdaycalendar object is created, you cannot modify the
    weekmask or holidays.  The attributes return copies of internal data.
    weekmask : (copy) seven-element array of bool
    holidays : (copy) sorted array of datetime64[D]

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Some important days in July
    ... bdd = np.busdaycalendar(
    ...             holidays=['2011-07-01', '2011-07-04', '2011-07-17'])
    >>> # Default is Monday to Friday weekdays
    ... bdd.weekmask
    array([ True,  True,  True,  True,  True, False, False], dtype='bool')
    >>> # Any holidays already on the weekend are removed
    ... bdd.holidays
    array(['2011-07-01', '2011-07-04'], dtype='datetime64[D]')
    
    dtype(obj, align=False, copy=False)

    Create a data type object.

    A numpy array is homogeneous, and contains elements described by a
    dtype object. A dtype object can be constructed from different
    combinations of fundamental numeric types.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj
        Object to be converted to a data type object.
    align : bool, optional
        Add padding to the fields to match what a C compiler would output
        for a similar C-struct. Can be ``True`` only if `obj` is a dictionary
        or a comma-separated string. If a struct dtype is being created,
        this also sets a sticky alignment flag ``isalignedstruct``.
    copy : bool, optional
        Make a new copy of the data-type object. If ``False``, the result
        may just be a reference to a built-in data-type object.

    See also
    --------
    result_type

    Examples
    --------
    Using array-scalar type:

    >>> np.dtype(np.int16)
    dtype('int16')

    Structured type, one field name 'f1', containing int16:

    >>> np.dtype([('f1', np.int16)])
    dtype([('f1', '<i2')])

    Structured type, one field named 'f1', in itself containing a structured
    type with one field:

    >>> np.dtype([('f1', [('f1', np.int16)])])
    dtype([('f1', [('f1', '<i2')])])

    Structured type, two fields: the first field contains an unsigned int, the
    second an int32:

    >>> np.dtype([('f1', np.uint), ('f2', np.int32)])
    dtype([('f1', '<u4'), ('f2', '<i4')])

    Using array-protocol type strings:

    >>> np.dtype([('a','f8'),('b','S10')])
    dtype([('a', '<f8'), ('b', '|S10')])

    Using comma-separated field formats.  The shape is (2,3):

    >>> np.dtype("i4, (2,3)f8")
    dtype([('f0', '<i4'), ('f1', '<f8', (2, 3))])

    Using tuples.  ``int`` is a fixed type, 3 the field's shape.  ``void``
    is a flexible type, here of size 10:

    >>> np.dtype([('hello',(int,3)),('world',np.void,10)])
    dtype([('hello', '<i4', 3), ('world', '|V10')])

    Subdivide ``int16`` into 2 ``int8``'s, called x and y.  0 and 1 are
    the offsets in bytes:

    >>> np.dtype((np.int16, {'x':(np.int8,0), 'y':(np.int8,1)}))
    dtype(('<i2', [('x', '|i1'), ('y', '|i1')]))

    Using dictionaries.  Two fields named 'gender' and 'age':

    >>> np.dtype({'names':['gender','age'], 'formats':['S1',np.uint8]})
    dtype([('gender', '|S1'), ('age', '|u1')])

    Offsets in bytes, here 0 and 25:

    >>> np.dtype({'surname':('S25',0),'age':(np.uint8,25)})
    dtype([('surname', '|S25'), ('age', '|u1')])

    Array priority.
    Abstract base class of all character string scalar types.
    
    reduceat
    reduceat(a, indices, axis=0, dtype=None, out=None)

    Performs a (local) reduce with specified slices over a single axis.

    For i in ``range(len(indices))``, `reduceat` computes
    ``ufunc.reduce(a[indices[i]:indices[i+1]])``, which becomes the i-th
    generalized "row" parallel to `axis` in the final result (i.e., in a
    2-D array, for example, if `axis = 0`, it becomes the i-th row, but if
    `axis = 1`, it becomes the i-th column).  There are three exceptions to this:

    * when ``i = len(indices) - 1`` (so for the last index),
      ``indices[i+1] = a.shape[axis]``.
    * if ``indices[i] >= indices[i + 1]``, the i-th generalized "row" is
      simply ``a[indices[i]]``.
    * if ``indices[i] >= len(a)`` or ``indices[i] < 0``, an error is raised.

    The shape of the output depends on the size of `indices`, and may be
    larger than `a` (this happens if ``len(indices) > a.shape[axis]``).

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The array to act on.
    indices : array_like
        Paired indices, comma separated (not colon), specifying slices to
        reduce.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which to apply the reduceat.
    dtype : data-type code, optional
        The type used to represent the intermediate results. Defaults
        to the data type of the output array if this is provided, or
        the data type of the input array if no output array is provided.
    out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated array is returned. For consistency with
        :ref:`ufunc.__call__`, if given as a keyword, this may be wrapped in a
        1-element tuple.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.13.0
           Tuples are allowed for keyword argument.

    Returns
    -------
    r : ndarray
        The reduced values. If `out` was supplied, `r` is a reference to
        `out`.

    Notes
    -----
    A descriptive example:

    If `a` is 1-D, the function `ufunc.accumulate(a)` is the same as
    ``ufunc.reduceat(a, indices)[::2]`` where `indices` is
    ``range(len(array) - 1)`` with a zero placed
    in every other element:
    ``indices = zeros(2 * len(a) - 1)``, ``indices[1::2] = range(1, len(a))``.

    Don't be fooled by this attribute's name: `reduceat(a)` is not
    necessarily smaller than `a`.

    Examples
    --------
    To take the running sum of four successive values:

    >>> np.add.reduceat(np.arange(8),[0,4, 1,5, 2,6, 3,7])[::2]
    array([ 6, 10, 14, 18])

    A 2-D example:

    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 15, 16).reshape(4,4)
    >>> x
    array([[  0.,   1.,   2.,   3.],
           [  4.,   5.,   6.,   7.],
           [  8.,   9.,  10.,  11.],
           [ 12.,  13.,  14.,  15.]])

    ::

     # reduce such that the result has the following five rows:
     # [row1 + row2 + row3]
     # [row4]
     # [row2]
     # [row3]
     # [row1 + row2 + row3 + row4]

    >>> np.add.reduceat(x, [0, 3, 1, 2, 0])
    array([[ 12.,  15.,  18.,  21.],
           [ 12.,  13.,  14.,  15.],
           [  4.,   5.,   6.,   7.],
           [  8.,   9.,  10.,  11.],
           [ 24.,  28.,  32.,  36.]])

    ::

     # reduce such that result has the following two columns:
     # [col1 * col2 * col3, col4]

    >>> np.multiply.reduceat(x, [0, 3], 1)
    array([[    0.,     3.],
           [  120.,     7.],
           [  720.,    11.],
           [ 2184.,    15.]])

    
    a.round(decimals=0, out=None)

    Return `a` with each element rounded to the given number of decimals.

    Refer to `numpy.around` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.around : equivalent function

    
    a.repeat(repeats, axis=None)

    Repeat elements of an array.

    Refer to `numpy.repeat` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.repeat : equivalent function

    
    Boolean indicating whether the byte order of this dtype is native
    to the platform.

    
    accumulate(array, axis=0, dtype=None, out=None)

    Accumulate the result of applying the operator to all elements.

    For a one-dimensional array, accumulate produces results equivalent to::

      r = np.empty(len(A))
      t = op.identity        # op = the ufunc being applied to A's  elements
      for i in range(len(A)):
          t = op(t, A[i])
          r[i] = t
      return r

    For example, add.accumulate() is equivalent to np.cumsum().

    For a multi-dimensional array, accumulate is applied along only one
    axis (axis zero by default; see Examples below) so repeated use is
    necessary if one wants to accumulate over multiple axes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : array_like
        The array to act on.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which to apply the accumulation; default is zero.
    dtype : data-type code, optional
        The data-type used to represent the intermediate results. Defaults
        to the data-type of the output array if such is provided, or the
        the data-type of the input array if no output array is provided.
    out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated array is returned. For consistency with
        :ref:`ufunc.__call__`, if given as a keyword, this may be wrapped in a
        1-element tuple.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.13.0
           Tuples are allowed for keyword argument.

    Returns
    -------
    r : ndarray
        The accumulated values. If `out` was supplied, `r` is a reference to
        `out`.

    a.nonzero()

    Return the indices of the elements that are non-zero.

    newbyteorder(new_order='S')

    Return a new dtype with a different byte order.

    Changes are also made in all fields and sub-arrays of the data type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    new_order : string, optional
        Byte order to force; a value from the byte order specifications
        below.  The default value ('S') results in swapping the current
        byte order.  `new_order` codes can be any of:

        * 'S' - swap dtype from current to opposite endian
        * {'<', 'L'} - little endian
        * {'>', 'B'} - big endian
        * {'=', 'N'} - native order
        * {'|', 'I'} - ignore (no change to byte order)

        The code does a case-insensitive check on the first letter of
        `new_order` for these alternatives.  For example, any of '>'
        or 'B' or 'b' or 'brian' are valid to specify big-endian.

    Returns
    -------
    new_dtype : dtype
        New dtype object with the given change to the byte order.

    Notes
    -----
    Changes are also made in all fields and sub-arrays of the data type.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import sys
    >>> sys_is_le = sys.byteorder == 'little'
    >>> native_code = sys_is_le and '<' or '>'
    >>> swapped_code = sys_is_le and '>' or '<'
    >>> native_dt = np.dtype(native_code+'i2')
    >>> swapped_dt = np.dtype(swapped_code+'i2')
    >>> native_dt.newbyteorder('S') == swapped_dt
    True
    >>> native_dt.newbyteorder() == swapped_dt
    True
    >>> native_dt == swapped_dt.newbyteorder('S')
    True
    >>> native_dt == swapped_dt.newbyteorder('=')
    True
    >>> native_dt == swapped_dt.newbyteorder('N')
    True
    >>> native_dt == native_dt.newbyteorder('|')
    True
    >>> np.dtype('<i2') == native_dt.newbyteorder('<')
    True
    >>> np.dtype('<i2') == native_dt.newbyteorder('L')
    True
    >>> np.dtype('>i2') == native_dt.newbyteorder('>')
    True
    >>> np.dtype('>i2') == native_dt.newbyteorder('B')
    True

    
    a.prod(axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, keepdims=False)

    Return the product of the array elements over the given axis

    Refer to `numpy.prod` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.prod : equivalent function

    
    a.byteswap(inplace=False)

    Swap the bytes of the array elements

    Toggle between low-endian and big-endian data representation by
    returning a byteswapped array, optionally swapped in-place.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inplace : bool, optional
        If ``True``, swap bytes in-place, default is ``False``.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The byteswapped array. If `inplace` is ``True``, this is
        a view to self.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> A = np.array([1, 256, 8755], dtype=np.int16)
    >>> map(hex, A)
    ['0x1', '0x100', '0x2233']
    >>> A.byteswap(inplace=True)
    array([  256,     1, 13090], dtype=int16)
    >>> map(hex, A)
    ['0x100', '0x1', '0x3322']

    Arrays of strings are not swapped

    >>> A = np.array(['ceg', 'fac'])
    >>> A.byteswap()
    array(['ceg', 'fac'],
          dtype='|S3')

    
    a.resize(new_shape, refcheck=True)

    Change shape and size of array in-place.

    Parameters
    ----------
    new_shape : tuple of ints, or `n` ints
        Shape of resized array.
    refcheck : bool, optional
        If False, reference count will not be checked. Default is True.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `a` does not own its own data or references or views to it exist,
        and the data memory must be changed.
        PyPy only: will always raise if the data memory must be changed, since
        there is no reliable way to determine if references or views to it
        exist.

    SystemError
        If the `order` keyword argument is specified. This behaviour is a
        bug in NumPy.

    See Also
    --------
    resize : Return a new array with the specified shape.

    Notes
    -----
    This reallocates space for the data area if necessary.

    Only contiguous arrays (data elements consecutive in memory) can be
    resized.

    The purpose of the reference count check is to make sure you
    do not use this array as a buffer for another Python object and then
    reallocate the memory. However, reference counts can increase in
    other ways so if you are sure that you have not shared the memory
    for this array with another Python object, then you may safely set
    `refcheck` to False.

    Examples
    --------
    Shrinking an array: array is flattened (in the order that the data are
    stored in memory), resized, and reshaped:

    >>> a = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]], order='C')
    >>> a.resize((2, 1))
    >>> a
    array([[0],
           [1]])

    >>> a = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]], order='F')
    >>> a.resize((2, 1))
    >>> a
    array([[0],
           [2]])

    Enlarging an array: as above, but missing entries are filled with zeros:

    >>> b = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]])
    >>> b.resize(2, 3) # new_shape parameter doesn't have to be a tuple
    >>> b
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 0, 0]])

    Referencing an array prevents resizing...

    >>> c = a
    >>> a.resize((1, 1))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: cannot resize an array that has been referenced ...

    Unless `refcheck` is False:

    >>> a.resize((1, 1), refcheck=False)
    >>> a
    array([[0]])
    >>> c
    array([[0]])

    Tuple of bytes steps in each dimension.<module numpy.core._add_newdocs>
    a.astype(dtype, order='K', casting='unsafe', subok=True, copy=True)

    Copy of the array, cast to a specified type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype : str or dtype
        Typecode or data-type to which the array is cast.
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
        Controls the memory layout order of the result.
        'C' means C order, 'F' means Fortran order, 'A'
        means 'F' order if all the arrays are Fortran contiguous,
        'C' order otherwise, and 'K' means as close to the
        order the array elements appear in memory as possible.
        Default is 'K'.
    casting : {'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}, optional
        Controls what kind of data casting may occur. Defaults to 'unsafe'
        for backwards compatibility.

          * 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.
          * 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.
          * 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
          * 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,
            like float64 to float32, are allowed.
          * 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.
    subok : bool, optional
        If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through (default), otherwise
        the returned array will be forced to be a base-class array.
    copy : bool, optional
        By default, astype always returns a newly allocated array. If this
        is set to false, and the `dtype`, `order`, and `subok`
        requirements are satisfied, the input array is returned instead
        of a copy.

    Returns
    -------
    arr_t : ndarray
        Unless `copy` is False and the other conditions for returning the input
        array are satisfied (see description for `copy` input parameter), `arr_t`
        is a new array of the same shape as the input array, with dtype, order
        given by `dtype`, `order`.

    Notes
    -----
    Starting in NumPy 1.9, astype method now returns an error if the string
    dtype to cast to is not long enough in 'safe' casting mode to hold the max
    value of integer/float array that is being casted. Previously the casting
    was allowed even if the result was truncated.

    Raises
    ------
    ComplexWarning
        When casting from complex to float or int. To avoid this,
        one should use ``a.real.astype(t)``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 2.5])
    >>> x
    array([ 1. ,  2. ,  2.5])

    >>> x.astype(int)
    array([1, 2, 2])

    Examples
    --------

    2

    
    Abstract base class of all numeric scalar types.
    
    
    a.getfield(dtype, offset=0)

    Returns a field of the given array as a certain type.

    A field is a view of the array data with a given data-type. The values in
    the view are determined by the given type and the offset into the current
    array in bytes. The offset needs to be such that the view dtype fits in the
    array dtype; for example an array of dtype complex128 has 16-byte elements.
    If taking a view with a 32-bit integer (4 bytes), the offset needs to be
    between 0 and 12 bytes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype : str or dtype
        The data type of the view. The dtype size of the view can not be larger
        than that of the array itself.
    offset : int
        Number of bytes to skip before beginning the element view.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.diag([1.+1.j]*2)
    >>> x[1, 1] = 2 + 4.j
    >>> x
    array([[ 1.+1.j,  0.+0.j],
           [ 0.+0.j,  2.+4.j]])
    >>> x.getfield(np.float64)
    array([[ 1.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  2.]])

    By choosing an offset of 8 bytes we can select the complex part of the
    array for our view:

    >>> x.getfield(np.float64, offset=8)
    array([[ 1.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  4.]])

    
    a.view(dtype=None, type=None)

    New view of array with the same data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype : data-type or ndarray sub-class, optional
        Data-type descriptor of the returned view, e.g., float32 or int16. The
        default, None, results in the view having the same data-type as `a`.
        This argument can also be specified as an ndarray sub-class, which
        then specifies the type of the returned object (this is equivalent to
        setting the ``type`` parameter).
    type : Python type, optional
        Type of the returned view, e.g., ndarray or matrix.  Again, the
        default None results in type preservation.

    Notes
    -----
    ``a.view()`` is used two different ways:

    ``a.view(some_dtype)`` or ``a.view(dtype=some_dtype)`` constructs a view
    of the array's memory with a different data-type.  This can cause a
    reinterpretation of the bytes of memory.

    ``a.view(ndarray_subclass)`` or ``a.view(type=ndarray_subclass)`` just
    returns an instance of `ndarray_subclass` that looks at the same array
    (same shape, dtype, etc.)  This does not cause a reinterpretation of the
    memory.

    For ``a.view(some_dtype)``, if ``some_dtype`` has a different number of
    bytes per entry than the previous dtype (for example, converting a
    regular array to a structured array), then the behavior of the view
    cannot be predicted just from the superficial appearance of ``a`` (shown
    by ``print(a)``). It also depends on exactly how ``a`` is stored in
    memory. Therefore if ``a`` is C-ordered versus fortran-ordered, versus
    defined as a slice or transpose, etc., the view may give different
    results.


    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([(1, 2)], dtype=[('a', np.int8), ('b', np.int8)])

    Viewing array data using a different type and dtype:

    >>> y = x.view(dtype=np.int16, type=np.matrix)
    >>> y
    matrix([[513]], dtype=int16)
    >>> print(type(y))
    <class 'numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix.matrix'>

    Creating a view on a structured array so it can be used in calculations

    >>> x = np.array([(1, 2),(3,4)], dtype=[('a', np.int8), ('b', np.int8)])
    >>> xv = x.view(dtype=np.int8).reshape(-1,2)
    >>> xv
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4]], dtype=int8)
    >>> xv.mean(0)
    array([ 2.,  3.])

    Making changes to the view changes the underlying array

    >>> xv[0,1] = 20
    >>> print(x)
    [(1, 20) (3, 4)]

    Using a view to convert an array to a recarray:

    >>> z = x.view(np.recarray)
    >>> z.a
    array([1], dtype=int8)

    Views share data:

    >>> x[0] = (9, 10)
    >>> z[0]
    (9, 10)

    Views that change the dtype size (bytes per entry) should normally be
    avoided on arrays defined by slices, transposes, fortran-ordering, etc.:

    >>> x = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], dtype=np.int16)
    >>> y = x[:, 0:2]
    >>> y
    array([[1, 2],
           [4, 5]], dtype=int16)
    >>> y.view(dtype=[('width', np.int16), ('length', np.int16)])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ValueError: new type not compatible with array.
    >>> z = y.copy()
    >>> z.view(dtype=[('width', np.int16), ('length', np.int16)])
    array([[(1, 2)],
           [(4, 5)]], dtype=[('width', '<i2'), ('length', '<i2')])
    
    The number of types.

    The number of numerical NumPy types - of which there are 18 total - on which
    the ufunc can operate.

    a.partition(kth, axis=-1, kind='introselect', order=None)

    Rearranges the elements in the array in such a way that the value of the
    element in kth position is in the position it would be in a sorted array.
    All elements smaller than the kth element are moved before this element and
    all equal or greater are moved behind it. The ordering of the elements in
    the two partitions is undefined.

    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    kth : int or sequence of ints
        Element index to partition by. The kth element value will be in its
        final sorted position and all smaller elements will be moved before it
        and all equal or greater elements behind it.
        The order of all elements in the partitions is undefined.
        If provided with a sequence of kth it will partition all elements
        indexed by kth of them into their sorted position at once.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to sort. Default is -1, which means sort along the
        last axis.
    kind : {'introselect'}, optional
        Selection algorithm. Default is 'introselect'.
    order : str or list of str, optional
        When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument specifies
        which fields to compare first, second, etc. A single field can
        be specified as a string, and not all fields need to be specified,
        but unspecified fields will still be used, in the order in which
        they come up in the dtype, to break ties.

    Notes
    -----
    See ``np.partition`` for notes on the different algorithms.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([3, 4, 2, 1])
    >>> a.partition(3)
    >>> a
    array([2, 1, 3, 4])

    >>> a.partition((1, 3))
    array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    bool8The real part of the scalar.
    A character indicating the byte-order of this data-type object.

    One of:

    ===  ==============
    '='  native
    '<'  little-endian
    '>'  big-endian
    '|'  not applicable
    ===  ==============

    All built-in data-type objects have byteorder either '=' or '|'.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> dt = np.dtype('i2')
    >>> dt.byteorder
    '='
    >>> # endian is not relevant for 8 bit numbers
    >>> np.dtype('i1').byteorder
    '|'
    >>> # or ASCII strings
    >>> np.dtype('S2').byteorder
    '|'
    >>> # Even if specific code is given, and it is native
    >>> # '=' is the byteorder
    >>> import sys
    >>> sys_is_le = sys.byteorder == 'little'
    >>> native_code = sys_is_le and '<' or '>'
    >>> swapped_code = sys_is_le and '>' or '<'
    >>> dt = np.dtype(native_code + 'i2')
    >>> dt.byteorder
    '='
    >>> # Swapped code shows up as itself
    >>> dt = np.dtype(swapped_code + 'i2')
    >>> dt.byteorder == swapped_code
    True

    iters
    tuple of iterators along ``self``'s "components."

    Returns a tuple of `numpy.flatiter` objects, one for each "component"
    of ``self``.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.flatiter

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> y = np.array([[4], [5], [6]])
    >>> b = np.broadcast(x, y)
    >>> row, col = b.iters
    >>> row.next(), col.next()
    (1, 4)

    remove_multi_index
    remove_multi_index()

    When the "multi_index" flag was specified, this removes it, allowing
    the internal iteration structure to be optimized further.

    itemset
    a.itemset(*args)

    Insert scalar into an array (scalar is cast to array's dtype, if possible)

    There must be at least 1 argument, and define the last argument
    as *item*.  Then, ``a.itemset(*args)`` is equivalent to but faster
    than ``a[args] = item``.  The item should be a scalar value and `args`
    must select a single item in the array `a`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    \*args : Arguments
        If one argument: a scalar, only used in case `a` is of size 1.
        If two arguments: the last argument is the value to be set
        and must be a scalar, the first argument specifies a single array
        element location. It is either an int or a tuple.

    Notes
    -----
    Compared to indexing syntax, `itemset` provides some speed increase
    for placing a scalar into a particular location in an `ndarray`,
    if you must do this.  However, generally this is discouraged:
    among other problems, it complicates the appearance of the code.
    Also, when using `itemset` (and `item`) inside a loop, be sure
    to assign the methods to a local variable to avoid the attribute
    look-up at each loop iteration.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.random.randint(9, size=(3, 3))
    >>> x
    array([[3, 1, 7],
           [2, 8, 3],
           [8, 5, 3]])
    >>> x.itemset(4, 0)
    >>> x.itemset((2, 2), 9)
    >>> x
    array([[3, 1, 7],
           [2, 0, 3],
           [8, 5, 9]])

    Alias *on this platform*: ``np.{}``: {}.
    
    zeros(shape, dtype=float, order='C')

    Return a new array of given shape and type, filled with zeros.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : int or tuple of ints
        Shape of the new array, e.g., ``(2, 3)`` or ``2``.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The desired data-type for the array, e.g., `numpy.int8`.  Default is
        `numpy.float64`.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional, default: 'C'
        Whether to store multi-dimensional data in row-major
        (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) order in
        memory.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of zeros with the given shape, dtype, and order.

    See Also
    --------
    zeros_like : Return an array of zeros with shape and type of input.
    empty : Return a new uninitialized array.
    ones : Return a new array setting values to one.
    full : Return a new array of given shape filled with value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.zeros(5)
    array([ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.])

    >>> np.zeros((5,), dtype=int)
    array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

    >>> np.zeros((2, 1))
    array([[ 0.],
           [ 0.]])

    >>> s = (2,2)
    >>> np.zeros(s)
    array([[ 0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0.]])

    >>> np.zeros((2,), dtype=[('x', 'i4'), ('y', 'i4')]) # custom dtype
    array([(0, 0), (0, 0)],
          dtype=[('x', '<i4'), ('y', '<i4')])

    
    `__array_interface__` description of the data-type.

    The format is that required by the 'descr' key in the
    `__array_interface__` attribute.

    Warning: This attribute exists specifically for `__array_interface__`,
    and is not a datatype description compatible with `np.dtype`.
    enable_external_loop
    enable_external_loop()

    When the "external_loop" was not used during construction, but
    is desired, this modifies the iterator to behave as if the flag
    was specified.

    Tuple of array dimensions.
    Number of elements in the array.

    Equal to ``np.prod(a.shape)``, i.e., the product of the array's
    dimensions.

    Notes
    -----
    `a.size` returns a standard arbitrary precision Python integer. This
    may not be the case with other methods of obtaining the same value
    (like the suggested ``np.prod(a.shape)``, which returns an instance
    of ``np.int_``), and may be relevant if the value is used further in
    calculations that may overflow a fixed size integer type.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.zeros((3, 5, 2), dtype=np.complex128)
    >>> x.size
    30
    >>> np.prod(x.shape)
    30

    
    Data-type of the array's elements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Returns
    -------
    d : numpy dtype object

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.dtype

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3]])
    >>> x.dtype
    dtype('int32')
    >>> type(x.dtype)
    <type 'numpy.dtype'>

    a.dump(file)

    Dump a pickle of the array to the specified file.
    The array can be read back with pickle.load or numpy.load.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file : str
        A string naming the dump file.

    
    a.std(axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, ddof=0, keepdims=False)

    Returns the standard deviation of the array elements along given axis.

    Refer to `numpy.std` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.std : equivalent function

    
    a.setflags(write=None, align=None, uic=None)

    Set array flags WRITEABLE, ALIGNED, (WRITEBACKIFCOPY and UPDATEIFCOPY),
    respectively.

    These Boolean-valued flags affect how numpy interprets the memory
    area used by `a` (see Notes below). The ALIGNED flag can only
    be set to True if the data is actually aligned according to the type.
    The WRITEBACKIFCOPY and (deprecated) UPDATEIFCOPY flags can never be set
    to True. The flag WRITEABLE can only be set to True if the array owns its
    own memory, or the ultimate owner of the memory exposes a writeable buffer
    interface, or is a string. (The exception for string is made so that
    unpickling can be done without copying memory.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    write : bool, optional
        Describes whether or not `a` can be written to.
    align : bool, optional
        Describes whether or not `a` is aligned properly for its type.
    uic : bool, optional
        Describes whether or not `a` is a copy of another "base" array.

    Notes
    -----
    Array flags provide information about how the memory area used
    for the array is to be interpreted. There are 7 Boolean flags
    in use, only four of which can be changed by the user:
    WRITEBACKIFCOPY, UPDATEIFCOPY, WRITEABLE, and ALIGNED.

    WRITEABLE (W) the data area can be written to;

    ALIGNED (A) the data and strides are aligned appropriately for the hardware
    (as determined by the compiler);

    UPDATEIFCOPY (U) (deprecated), replaced by WRITEBACKIFCOPY;

    WRITEBACKIFCOPY (X) this array is a copy of some other array (referenced
    by .base). When the C-API function PyArray_ResolveWritebackIfCopy is
    called, the base array will be updated with the contents of this array.

    All flags can be accessed using the single (upper case) letter as well
    as the full name.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> y
    array([[3, 1, 7],
           [2, 0, 0],
           [8, 5, 9]])
    >>> y.flags
      C_CONTIGUOUS : True
      F_CONTIGUOUS : False
      OWNDATA : True
      WRITEABLE : True
      ALIGNED : True
      WRITEBACKIFCOPY : False
      UPDATEIFCOPY : False
    >>> y.setflags(write=0, align=0)
    >>> y.flags
      C_CONTIGUOUS : True
      F_CONTIGUOUS : False
      OWNDATA : True
      WRITEABLE : False
      ALIGNED : False
      WRITEBACKIFCOPY : False
      UPDATEIFCOPY : False
    >>> y.setflags(uic=1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ValueError: cannot set WRITEBACKIFCOPY flag to True

    copyto(dst, src, casting='same_kind', where=True)

    Copies values from one array to another, broadcasting as necessary.

    Raises a TypeError if the `casting` rule is violated, and if
    `where` is provided, it selects which elements to copy.

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    dst : ndarray
        The array into which values are copied.
    src : array_like
        The array from which values are copied.
    casting : {'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}, optional
        Controls what kind of data casting may occur when copying.

          * 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.
          * 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.
          * 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
          * 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,
            like float64 to float32, are allowed.
          * 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.
    where : array_like of bool, optional

    Tuple of array dimensions.

    The shape property is usually used to get the current shape of an array,
    but may also be used to reshape the array in-place by assigning a tuple of
    array dimensions to it.  As with `numpy.reshape`, one of the new shape
    dimensions can be -1, in which case its value is inferred from the size of
    the array and the remaining dimensions. Reshaping an array in-place will
    fail if a copy is required.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> x.shape
    (4,)
    >>> y = np.zeros((2, 3, 4))
    >>> y.shape
    (2, 3, 4)
    >>> y.shape = (3, 8)
    >>> y

           [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.]])
    >>> y.shape = (3, 6)

    See Also
    --------

    a.copy(order='C')

    Return a copy of the array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
        Controls the memory layout of the copy. 'C' means C-order,
        'F' means F-order, 'A' means 'F' if `a` is Fortran contiguous,
        'C' otherwise. 'K' means match the layout of `a` as closely
        as possible. (Note that this function and :func:`numpy.copy` are very
        similar, but have different default values for their order=
        arguments.)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], order='F')

    >>> y = x.copy()

    >>> x.fill(0)

    >>> x
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0]])

    >>> y
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])

    >>> y.flags['C_CONTIGUOUS']
    True

    Python buffer object pointing to the start of the array's data.
    Definition of the core elements a generalized ufunc operates on.

    The signature determines how the dimensions of each input/output array
    are split into core and loop dimensions:

    1. Each dimension in the signature is matched to a dimension of the
       corresponding passed-in array, starting from the end of the shape tuple.
    2. Core dimensions assigned to the same label in the signature must have
       exactly matching sizes, no broadcasting is performed.
    3. The core dimensions are removed from all inputs and the remaining
       dimensions are broadcast together, defining the loop dimensions.

    Notes
    -----
    Generalized ufuncs are used internally in many linalg functions, and in
    the testing suite; the examples below are taken from these.
    For ufuncs that operate on scalars, the signature is `None`, which is
    equivalent to '()' for every argument.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.core.umath_tests.matrix_multiply.signature
    '(m,n),(n,p)->(m,p)'
    >>> np.linalg._umath_linalg.det.signature
    '(m,m)->()'
    >>> np.add.signature is None
    True  # equivalent to '(),()->()'
    The length of one element in bytes.
    Create nditers for use in nested loops

    Create a tuple of `nditer` objects which iterate in nested loops over
    different axes of the op argument. The first iterator is used in the
    outermost loop, the last in the innermost loop. Advancing one will change
    the subsequent iterators to point at its new element.

    Parameters
    ----------
    op : ndarray or sequence of array_like
        The array(s) to iterate over.

    axes : list of list of int
        Each item is used as an "op_axes" argument to an nditer

    flags, op_flags, op_dtypes, order, casting, buffersize (optional)
        See `nditer` parameters of the same name

    Returns
    -------
    iters : tuple of nditer
        An nditer for each item in `axes`, outermost first

    See Also
    --------
    nditer

    Examples
    --------

    Basic usage. Note how y is the "flattened" version of
    [a[:, 0, :], a[:, 1, 0], a[:, 2, :]] since we specified
    the first iter's axes as [1]

    >>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(2, 3, 2)
    >>> i, j = np.nested_iters(a, [[1], [0, 2]], flags=["multi_index"])
    >>> for x in i:

    seterrobj(errobj)

    Set the object that defines floating-point error handling.

    The error object contains all information that defines the error handling
    behavior in NumPy. `seterrobj` is used internally by the other
    functions that set error handling behavior (`seterr`, `seterrcall`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    errobj : list
        The error object, a list containing three elements:
        [internal numpy buffer size, error mask, error callback function].

        The error mask is a single integer that holds the treatment information
        on all four floating point errors. The information for each error type
        is contained in three bits of the integer. If we print it in base 8, we
        can see what treatment is set for "invalid", "under", "over", and
        "divide" (in that order). The printed string can be interpreted with

        * 0 : 'ignore'
        * 1 : 'warn'
        * 2 : 'raise'
        * 3 : 'call'
        * 4 : 'print'
        * 5 : 'log'

    Notes
    -----
    For complete documentation of the types of floating-point exceptions and
    treatment options, see `seterr`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> old_errobj = np.geterrobj()  # first get the defaults
    >>> old_errobj
    [10000, 0, None]

    >>> def err_handler(type, flag):
    ...     print("Floating point error (%s), with flag %s" % (type, flag))
    ...
    >>> new_errobj = [20000, 12, err_handler]
    >>> np.seterrobj(new_errobj)
    >>> np.base_repr(12, 8)  # int for divide=4 ('print') and over=1 ('warn')
    '14'
    >>> np.geterr()
    {'over': 'warn', 'divide': 'print', 'invalid': 'ignore', 'under': 'ignore'}
    >>> np.geterrcall() is err_handler
    True

    Efficient multi-dimensional iterator object to iterate over arrays.
    To get started using this object, see the
    :ref:`introductory guide to array iteration <arrays.nditer>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    op : ndarray or sequence of array_like
        The array(s) to iterate over.
    flags : sequence of str, optional
        Flags to control the behavior of the iterator.

          * "buffered" enables buffering when required.
          * "c_index" causes a C-order index to be tracked.
          * "f_index" causes a Fortran-order index to be tracked.
          * "multi_index" causes a multi-index, or a tuple of indices
            with one per iteration dimension, to be tracked.
          * "common_dtype" causes all the operands to be converted to
            a common data type, with copying or buffering as necessary.
          * "copy_if_overlap" causes the iterator to determine if read
            operands have overlap with write operands, and make temporary
            copies as necessary to avoid overlap. False positives (needless
            copying) are possible in some cases.
          * "delay_bufalloc" delays allocation of the buffers until
            a reset() call is made. Allows "allocate" operands to
            be initialized before their values are copied into the buffers.
          * "external_loop" causes the `values` given to be
            one-dimensional arrays with multiple values instead of
            zero-dimensional arrays.
          * "grow_inner" allows the `value` array sizes to be made
            larger than the buffer size when both "buffered" and
            "external_loop" is used.
          * "ranged" allows the iterator to be restricted to a sub-range
            of the iterindex values.
          * "refs_ok" enables iteration of reference types, such as
            object arrays.
          * "reduce_ok" enables iteration of "readwrite" operands
            which are broadcasted, also known as reduction operands.
          * "zerosize_ok" allows `itersize` to be zero.
    op_flags : list of list of str, optional
        This is a list of flags for each operand. At minimum, one of
        "readonly", "readwrite", or "writeonly" must be specified.

          * "readonly" indicates the operand will only be read from.
          * "readwrite" indicates the operand will be read from and written to.
          * "writeonly" indicates the operand will only be written to.
          * "no_broadcast" prevents the operand from being broadcasted.
          * "contig" forces the operand data to be contiguous.
          * "aligned" forces the operand data to be aligned.
          * "nbo" forces the operand data to be in native byte order.
          * "copy" allows a temporary read-only copy if required.
          * "updateifcopy" allows a temporary read-write copy if required.
          * "allocate" causes the array to be allocated if it is None
            in the `op` parameter.
          * "no_subtype" prevents an "allocate" operand from using a subtype.
          * "arraymask" indicates that this operand is the mask to use
            for selecting elements when writing to operands with the
            'writemasked' flag set. The iterator does not enforce this,
            but when writing from a buffer back to the array, it only
            copies those elements indicated by this mask.
          * 'writemasked' indicates that only elements where the chosen
            'arraymask' operand is True will be written to.
          * "overlap_assume_elementwise" can be used to mark operands that are
            accessed only in the iterator order, to allow less conservative
            copying when "copy_if_overlap" is present.
    op_dtypes : dtype or tuple of dtype(s), optional
        The required data type(s) of the operands. If copying or buffering
        is enabled, the data will be converted to/from their original types.
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
        Controls the iteration order. 'C' means C order, 'F' means
        Fortran order, 'A' means 'F' order if all the arrays are Fortran
        contiguous, 'C' order otherwise, and 'K' means as close to the
        order the array elements appear in memory as possible. This also
        affects the element memory order of "allocate" operands, as they
        are allocated to be compatible with iteration order.
        Default is 'K'.
    casting : {'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}, optional
        Controls what kind of data casting may occur when making a copy
        or buffering.  Setting this to 'unsafe' is not recommended,
        as it can adversely affect accumulations.

          * 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.
          * 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.
          * 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
          * 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,
            like float64 to float32, are allowed.
          * 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.
    op_axes : list of list of ints, optional
        If provided, is a list of ints or None for each operands.
        The list of axes for an operand is a mapping from the dimensions
        of the iterator to the dimensions of the operand. A value of
        -1 can be placed for entries, causing that dimension to be
        treated as "newaxis".
    itershape : tuple of ints, optional
        The desired shape of the iterator. This allows "allocate" operands
        with a dimension mapped by op_axes not corresponding to a dimension
        of a different operand to get a value not equal to 1 for that
        dimension.
    buffersize : int, optional
        When buffering is enabled, controls the size of the temporary
        buffers. Set to 0 for the default value.

    Attributes
    ----------
    dtypes : tuple of dtype(s)
        The data types of the values provided in `value`. This may be
        different from the operand data types if buffering is enabled.
        Valid only before the iterator is closed.
    finished : bool
        Whether the iteration over the operands is finished or not.
    has_delayed_bufalloc : bool
        If True, the iterator was created with the "delay_bufalloc" flag,
        and no reset() function was called on it yet.
    has_index : bool
        If True, the iterator was created with either the "c_index" or
        the "f_index" flag, and the property `index` can be used to
        retrieve it.
    has_multi_index : bool
        If True, the iterator was created with the "multi_index" flag,
        and the property `multi_index` can be used to retrieve it.
    index
        When the "c_index" or "f_index" flag was used, this property
        provides access to the index. Raises a ValueError if accessed
        and `has_index` is False.
    iterationneedsapi : bool
        Whether iteration requires access to the Python API, for example
        if one of the operands is an object array.
    iterindex : int
        An index which matches the order of iteration.
    itersize : int
        Size of the iterator.
    itviews
        Structured view(s) of `operands` in memory, matching the reordered
        and optimized iterator access pattern. Valid only before the iterator
        is closed.
    multi_index
        When the "multi_index" flag was used, this property
        provides access to the index. Raises a ValueError if accessed
        accessed and `has_multi_index` is False.
    ndim : int
        The iterator's dimension.
    nop : int
        The number of iterator operands.
    operands : tuple of operand(s)
        The array(s) to be iterated over. Valid only before the iterator is
        closed.
    shape : tuple of ints
        Shape tuple, the shape of the iterator.
    value
        Value of `operands` at current iteration. Normally, this is a
        tuple of array scalars, but if the flag "external_loop" is used,
        it is a tuple of one dimensional arrays.

    Notes
    -----
    `nditer` supersedes `flatiter`.  The iterator implementation behind
    `nditer` is also exposed by the NumPy C API.

    The Python exposure supplies two iteration interfaces, one which follows
    the Python iterator protocol, and another which mirrors the C-style
    do-while pattern.  The native Python approach is better in most cases, but
    if you need the iterator's coordinates or index, use the C-style pattern.

    Examples
    --------
    Here is how we might write an ``iter_add`` function, using the
    Python iterator protocol::

        def iter_add_py(x, y, out=None):
            addop = np.add
            it = np.nditer([x, y, out], [],
                        [['readonly'], ['readonly'], ['writeonly','allocate']])
            with it:
                for (a, b, c) in it:
                    addop(a, b, out=c)
            return it.operands[2]

    Here is the same function, but following the C-style pattern::

        def iter_add(x, y, out=None):
            addop = np.add

            it = np.nditer([x, y, out], [],
                        [['readonly'], ['readonly'], ['writeonly','allocate']])
            with it:
                while not it.finished:
                    addop(it[0], it[1], out=it[2])
                    it.iternext()

                return it.operands[2]

    Here is an example outer product function::

        def outer_it(x, y, out=None):
            mulop = np.multiply

            it = np.nditer([x, y, out], ['external_loop'],
                    [['readonly'], ['readonly'], ['writeonly', 'allocate']],
                    op_axes=[list(range(x.ndim)) + [-1] * y.ndim,
                             [-1] * x.ndim + list(range(y.ndim)),
                             None])
            with it:
                for (a, b, c) in it:
                    mulop(a, b, out=c)
                return it.operands[2]

        >>> a = np.arange(2)+1
        >>> b = np.arange(3)+1
        >>> outer_it(a,b)
        array([[1, 2, 3],
               [2, 4, 6]])

    Here is an example function which operates like a "lambda" ufunc::

        def luf(lamdaexpr, *args, **kwargs):
            "luf(lambdaexpr, op1, ..., opn, out=None, order='K', casting='safe', buffersize=0)"
            nargs = len(args)
            op = (kwargs.get('out',None),) + args
            it = np.nditer(op, ['buffered','external_loop'],
                    [['writeonly','allocate','no_broadcast']] +
                                    [['readonly','nbo','aligned']]*nargs,
                    order=kwargs.get('order','K'),
                    casting=kwargs.get('casting','safe'),
                    buffersize=kwargs.get('buffersize',0))
            while not it.finished:
                it[0] = lamdaexpr(*it[1:])
                it.iternext()
                return it.operands[0]

        >>> a = np.arange(5)
        >>> b = np.ones(5)
        >>> luf(lambda i,j:i*i + j/2, a, b)
        array([  0.5,   1.5,   4.5,   9.5,  16.5])

    If operand flags `"writeonly"` or `"readwrite"` are used the operands may
    be views into the original data with the `WRITEBACKIFCOPY` flag. In this case
    nditer must be used as a context manager or the nditer.close
    method must be called before using the result. The temporary
    data will be written back to the original data when the `__exit__`
    function is called but not before:

        >>> a = np.arange(6, dtype='i4')[::-2]
        >>> with nditer(a, [],
        ...        [['writeonly', 'updateifcopy']],
        ...        casting='unsafe',
        ...        op_dtypes=[np.dtype('f4')]) as i:
        ...    x = i.operands[0]
        ...    x[:] = [-1, -2, -3]
        ...    # a still unchanged here
        >>> a, x
        array([-1, -2, -3]), array([-1, -2, -3])

    It is important to note that once the iterator is exited, dangling
    references (like `x` in the example) may or may not share data with
    the original data `a`. If writeback semantics were active, i.e. if
    `x.base.flags.writebackifcopy` is `True`, then exiting the iterator
    will sever the connection between `x` and `a`, writing to `x` will
    no longer write to `a`. If writeback semantics are not active, then
    `x.data` will still point at some part of `a.data`, and writing to
    one will affect the other.

    
    Length of one array element in bytes.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1,2,3], dtype=np.float64)
    >>> x.itemsize
    8
    >>> x = np.array([1,2,3], dtype=np.complex128)
    >>> x.itemsize
    16

    
    a.trace(offset=0, axis1=0, axis2=1, dtype=None, out=None)

    Return the sum along diagonals of the array.

    Refer to `numpy.trace` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.trace : equivalent function

    
    a.flatten(order='C')

    Return a copy of the array collapsed into one dimension.

    Parameters
    ----------
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
        'C' means to flatten in row-major (C-style) order.
        'F' means to flatten in column-major (Fortran-
        style) order. 'A' means to flatten in column-major
        order if `a` is Fortran *contiguous* in memory,
        row-major order otherwise. 'K' means to flatten
        `a` in the order the elements occur in memory.
        The default is 'C'.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        A copy of the input array, flattened to one dimension.

    See Also
    --------
    ravel : Return a flattened array.
    flat : A 1-D flat iterator over the array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1,2], [3,4]])
    >>> a.flatten()
    array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> a.flatten('F')
    array([1, 3, 2, 4])

    _fastCopyAndTranspose(a)
    {doc}
    Character code: ``'{character_code}'``.
    {canonical_name_doc}{alias_doc}
    
    a.tofile(fid, sep="", format="%s")

    Write array to a file as text or binary (default).

    Data is always written in 'C' order, independent of the order of `a`.
    The data produced by this method can be recovered using the function
    fromfile().

    Parameters
    ----------
    fid : file or str
        An open file object, or a string containing a filename.
    sep : str
        Separator between array items for text output.
        If "" (empty), a binary file is written, equivalent to
        ``file.write(a.tobytes())``.
    format : str
        Format string for text file output.
        Each entry in the array is formatted to text by first converting
        it to the closest Python type, and then using "format" % item.

    Notes
    -----
    This is a convenience function for quick storage of array data.
    Information on endianness and precision is lost, so this method is not a
    good choice for files intended to archive data or transport data between
    machines with different endianness. Some of these problems can be overcome
    by outputting the data as text files, at the expense of speed and file
    size.

    When fid is a file object, array contents are directly written to the
    file, bypassing the file object's ``write`` method. As a result, tofile
    cannot be used with files objects supporting compression (e.g., GzipFile)
    or file-like objects that do not support ``fileno()`` (e.g., BytesIO).

    
    ndarray(shape, dtype=float, buffer=None, offset=0,
            strides=None, order=None)

    An array object represents a multidimensional, homogeneous array
    of fixed-size items.  An associated data-type object describes the
    format of each element in the array (its byte-order, how many bytes it
    occupies in memory, whether it is an integer, a floating point number,
    or something else, etc.)

    Arrays should be constructed using `array`, `zeros` or `empty` (refer
    to the See Also section below).  The parameters given here refer to
    a low-level method (`ndarray(...)`) for instantiating an array.

    For more information, refer to the `numpy` module and examine the
    methods and attributes of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    (for the __new__ method; see Notes below)

    shape : tuple of ints
        Shape of created array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Any object that can be interpreted as a numpy data type.
    buffer : object exposing buffer interface, optional
        Used to fill the array with data.
    offset : int, optional
        Offset of array data in buffer.
    strides : tuple of ints, optional
        Strides of data in memory.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
        Row-major (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) order.

    Attributes
    ----------
    T : ndarray
        Transpose of the array.
    data : buffer
        The array's elements, in memory.
    dtype : dtype object
        Describes the format of the elements in the array.
    flags : dict
        Dictionary containing information related to memory use, e.g.,
        'C_CONTIGUOUS', 'OWNDATA', 'WRITEABLE', etc.
    flat : numpy.flatiter object
        Flattened version of the array as an iterator.  The iterator
        allows assignments, e.g., ``x.flat = 3`` (See `ndarray.flat` for
        assignment examples; TODO).
    imag : ndarray
        Imaginary part of the array.
    real : ndarray
        Real part of the array.
    size : int
        Number of elements in the array.
    itemsize : int
        The memory use of each array element in bytes.
    nbytes : int
        The total number of bytes required to store the array data,
        i.e., ``itemsize * size``.
    ndim : int
        The array's number of dimensions.
    shape : tuple of ints
        Shape of the array.
    strides : tuple of ints
        The step-size required to move from one element to the next in
        memory. For example, a contiguous ``(3, 4)`` array of type
        ``int16`` in C-order has strides ``(8, 2)``.  This implies that
        to move from element to element in memory requires jumps of 2 bytes.
        To move from row-to-row, one needs to jump 8 bytes at a time
        (``2 * 4``).
    ctypes : ctypes object
        Class containing properties of the array needed for interaction
        with ctypes.
    base : ndarray
        If the array is a view into another array, that array is its `base`
        (unless that array is also a view).  The `base` array is where the
        array data is actually stored.

    See Also
    --------
    array : Construct an array.
    zeros : Create an array, each element of which is zero.
    empty : Create an array, but leave its allocated memory unchanged (i.e.,
            it contains "garbage").
    dtype : Create a data-type.

    Notes
    -----
    There are two modes of creating an array using ``__new__``:

    1. If `buffer` is None, then only `shape`, `dtype`, and `order`
       are used.
    2. If `buffer` is an object exposing the buffer interface, then
       all keywords are interpreted.

    No ``__init__`` method is needed because the array is fully initialized
    after the ``__new__`` method.

    Examples
    --------
    These examples illustrate the low-level `ndarray` constructor.  Refer
    to the `See Also` section above for easier ways of constructing an
    ndarray.

    First mode, `buffer` is None:

    >>> np.ndarray(shape=(2,2), dtype=float, order='F')
    array([[ -1.13698227e+002,   4.25087011e-303],
           [  2.88528414e-306,   3.27025015e-309]])         #random

    Second mode:

    >>> np.ndarray((2,), buffer=np.array([1,2,3]),
    ...            offset=np.int_().itemsize,
    ...            dtype=int) # offset = 1*itemsize, i.e. skip first element
    array([2, 3])

    
    a.argsort(axis=-1, kind='quicksort', order=None)

    Returns the indices that would sort this array.

    Refer to `numpy.argsort` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.argsort : equivalent function

    
    frombuffer(buffer, dtype=float, count=-1, offset=0)

    Interpret a buffer as a 1-dimensional array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    buffer : buffer_like
        An object that exposes the buffer interface.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Data-type of the returned array; default: float.
    count : int, optional
        Number of items to read. ``-1`` means all data in the buffer.
    offset : int, optional
        Start reading the buffer from this offset (in bytes); default: 0.

    Notes
    -----
    If the buffer has data that is not in machine byte-order, this should
    be specified as part of the data-type, e.g.::

      >>> dt = np.dtype(int)
      >>> dt = dt.newbyteorder('>')
      >>> np.frombuffer(buf, dtype=dt)

    The data of the resulting array will not be byteswapped, but will be
    interpreted correctly.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> s = 'hello world'
    >>> np.frombuffer(s, dtype='S1', count=5, offset=6)
    array(['w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd'],
          dtype='|S1')

    >>> np.frombuffer(b'\x01\x02', dtype=np.uint8)
    array([1, 2], dtype=uint8)
    >>> np.frombuffer(b'\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05', dtype=np.uint8, count=3)
    array([1, 2, 3], dtype=uint8)

    
    outer(A, B, **kwargs)

    Apply the ufunc `op` to all pairs (a, b) with a in `A` and b in `B`.

    Let ``M = A.ndim``, ``N = B.ndim``. Then the result, `C`, of
    ``op.outer(A, B)`` is an array of dimension M + N such that:

    .. math:: C[i_0, ..., i_{M-1}, j_0, ..., j_{N-1}] =
       op(A[i_0, ..., i_{M-1}], B[j_0, ..., j_{N-1}])

    For `A` and `B` one-dimensional, this is equivalent to::

      r = empty(len(A),len(B))
      for i in range(len(A)):
          for j in range(len(B)):
              r[i,j] = op(A[i], B[j]) # op = ufunc in question

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : array_like
        First array
    B : array_like
        Second array
    kwargs : any
        Arguments to pass on to the ufunc. Typically `dtype` or `out`.

    Returns
    -------
    r : ndarray
        Output array

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.outer

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.multiply.outer([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
    array([[ 4,  5,  6],
           [ 8, 10, 12],
           [12, 15, 18]])

    A multi-dimensional example:

    (2, 3, 1, 4)
    array([[[[ 1,  2,  3,  4]],
            [[ 2,  4,  6,  8]],
            [[ 3,  6,  9, 12]]],

            [[ 5, 10, 15, 20]],
            [[ 6, 12, 18, 24]]]])

    
    Flat iterator object to iterate over arrays.

    A `flatiter` iterator is returned by ``x.flat`` for any array `x`.
    It allows iterating over the array as if it were a 1-D array,
    either in a for-loop or by calling its `next` method.

    Iteration is done in row-major, C-style order (the last
    index varying the fastest). The iterator can also be indexed using
    basic slicing or advanced indexing.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.flat : Return a flat iterator over an array.
    ndarray.flatten : Returns a flattened copy of an array.

    Notes
    -----
    A `flatiter` iterator can not be constructed directly from Python code
    by calling the `flatiter` constructor.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
    >>> fl = x.flat
    >>> type(fl)
    <type 'numpy.flatiter'>
    >>> for item in fl:
    ...     print(item)
    ...
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5

    >>> fl[2:4]
    array([2, 3])

    
    fromfile(file, dtype=float, count=-1, sep='')

    Construct an array from data in a text or binary file.

    A highly efficient way of reading binary data with a known data-type,
    as well as parsing simply formatted text files.  Data written using the
    `tofile` method can be read using this function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file : file or str
        Open file object or filename.
    dtype : data-type
        Data type of the returned array.
        For binary files, it is used to determine the size and byte-order
        of the items in the file.
    count : int
        Number of items to read. ``-1`` means all items (i.e., the complete
        file).
    sep : str
        Separator between items if file is a text file.
        Empty ("") separator means the file should be treated as binary.
        Spaces (" ") in the separator match zero or more whitespace characters.
        A separator consisting only of spaces must match at least one
        whitespace.

    See also
    --------
    load, save
    ndarray.tofile
    loadtxt : More flexible way of loading data from a text file.

    Notes
    -----
    Do not rely on the combination of `tofile` and `fromfile` for
    data storage, as the binary files generated are are not platform
    independent.  In particular, no byte-order or data-type information is
    saved.  Data can be stored in the platform independent ``.npy`` format
    using `save` and `load` instead.

    Examples
    --------
    Construct an ndarray:

    >>> dt = np.dtype([('time', [('min', int), ('sec', int)]),
    ...                ('temp', float)])
    >>> x = np.zeros((1,), dtype=dt)
    >>> x['time']['min'] = 10; x['temp'] = 98.25
    >>> x
    array([((10, 0), 98.25)],
          dtype=[('time', [('min', '<i4'), ('sec', '<i4')]), ('temp', '<f8')])

    Save the raw data to disk:

    >>> import os
    >>> fname = os.tmpnam()
    >>> x.tofile(fname)

    Read the raw data from disk:

    >>> np.fromfile(fname, dtype=dt)
    array([((10, 0), 98.25)],
          dtype=[('time', [('min', '<i4'), ('sec', '<i4')]), ('temp', '<f8')])

    The recommended way to store and load data:

    >>> np.save(fname, x)
    >>> np.load(fname + '.npy')
    array([((10, 0), 98.25)],
          dtype=[('time', [('min', '<i4'), ('sec', '<i4')]), ('temp', '<f8')])

    
    The identity value.

    Data attribute containing the identity element for the ufunc, if it has one.
    If it does not, the attribute value is None.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.add.identity
    0
    >>> np.multiply.identity
    1
    >>> np.power.identity
    1
    >>> print(np.exp.identity)
    None
    a.__deepcopy__(memo, /) -> Deep copy of array.

    Used if :func:`copy.deepcopy` is called on an array.

    The type object used to instantiate a scalar of this data-type.
    a.reshape(shape, order='C')

    Returns an array containing the same data with a new shape.

    Refer to `numpy.reshape` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.reshape : equivalent function

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike the free function `numpy.reshape`, this method on `ndarray` allows
    the elements of the shape parameter to be passed in as separate arguments.
    For example, ``a.reshape(10, 11)`` is equivalent to
    ``a.reshape((10, 11))``.

    a.__array_wrap__(obj) -> Object of same type as ndarray object a.

    
    Double-precision floating-point number type, compatible with Python `float`
    and C ``double``.
    The length of the scalar in bytes.
    Shape tuple of the sub-array if this data type describes a sub-array,
    and ``()`` otherwise.

    
    a.sort(axis=-1, kind='quicksort', order=None)

    Sort an array, in-place.

    Parameters
    ----------
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to sort. Default is -1, which means sort along the
        last axis.
    kind : {'quicksort', 'mergesort', 'heapsort', 'stable'}, optional
        Sorting algorithm. Default is 'quicksort'.
    order : str or list of str, optional
        When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument specifies
        which fields to compare first, second, etc.  A single field can
        be specified as a string, and not all fields need be specified,
        but unspecified fields will still be used, in the order in which
        they come up in the dtype, to break ties.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.sort : Return a sorted copy of an array.
    argsort : Indirect sort.
    lexsort : Indirect stable sort on multiple keys.
    searchsorted : Find elements in sorted array.
    partition: Partial sort.

    Notes
    -----
    See ``sort`` for notes on the different sorting algorithms.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1,4], [3,1]])
    >>> a.sort(axis=1)
    >>> a
    array([[1, 4],
           [1, 3]])
    >>> a.sort(axis=0)
    >>> a
    array([[1, 3],
           [1, 4]])

    Use the `order` keyword to specify a field to use when sorting a
    structured array:

    >>> a = np.array([('a', 2), ('c', 1)], dtype=[('x', 'S1'), ('y', int)])
    >>> a.sort(order='y')
    >>> a
    array([('c', 1), ('a', 2)],
          dtype=[('x', '|S1'), ('y', '<i4')])

    _get_ndarray_c_version
    a.conjugate()

    Return the complex conjugate, element-wise.

    Refer to `numpy.conjugate` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.conjugate : equivalent function

    a.__reduce__()

    For pickling.

    
    Number of array dimensions.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> x.ndim
    1
    >>> y = np.zeros((2, 3, 4))
    >>> y.ndim
    3

    
    Complex number type composed of two double-precision floating-point
    numbers, compatible with Python `complex`.
    
    reduce(a, axis=0, dtype=None, out=None, keepdims=False, initial)

    Reduces `a`'s dimension by one, by applying ufunc along one axis.

    Let :math:`a.shape = (N_0, ..., N_i, ..., N_{M-1})`.  Then
    :math:`ufunc.reduce(a, axis=i)[k_0, ..,k_{i-1}, k_{i+1}, .., k_{M-1}]` =
    the result of iterating `j` over :math:`range(N_i)`, cumulatively applying
    ufunc to each :math:`a[k_0, ..,k_{i-1}, j, k_{i+1}, .., k_{M-1}]`.
    For a one-dimensional array, reduce produces results equivalent to:
    ::

     r = op.identity # op = ufunc
     for i in range(len(A)):
       r = op(r, A[i])
     return r

    For example, add.reduce() is equivalent to sum().

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The array to act on.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which a reduction is performed.
        The default (`axis` = 0) is perform a reduction over the first
        dimension of the input array. `axis` may be negative, in
        which case it counts from the last to the first axis.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If this is `None`, a reduction is performed over all the axes.
        If this is a tuple of ints, a reduction is performed on multiple
        axes, instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.

        For operations which are either not commutative or not associative,
        doing a reduction over multiple axes is not well-defined. The
        ufuncs do not currently raise an exception in this case, but will
        likely do so in the future.
    dtype : data-type code, optional
        The type used to represent the intermediate results. Defaults
        to the data-type of the output array if this is provided, or
        the data-type of the input array if no output array is provided.
    out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated array is returned. For consistency with
        :ref:`ufunc.__call__`, if given as a keyword, this may be wrapped in a
        1-element tuple.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.13.0
           Tuples are allowed for keyword argument.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `arr`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
    initial : scalar, optional
        The value with which to start the reduction.
        If the ufunc has no identity or the dtype is object, this defaults
        to None - otherwise it defaults to ufunc.identity.
        If ``None`` is given, the first element of the reduction is used,
        and an error is thrown if the reduction is empty.

        .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

    Returns
    -------
    r : ndarray
        The reduced array. If `out` was supplied, `r` is a reference to it.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.multiply.reduce([2,3,5])
    30

    A multi-dimensional array example:

    >>> X = np.arange(8).reshape((2,2,2))
    >>> X
    array([[[0, 1],
            [2, 3]],
           [[4, 5],
            [6, 7]]])
    >>> np.add.reduce(X, 0)
    array([[ 4,  6],
           [ 8, 10]])
    >>> np.add.reduce(X) # confirm: default axis value is 0
    array([[ 4,  6],
           [ 8, 10]])
    >>> np.add.reduce(X, 1)
    array([[ 2,  4],
           [10, 12]])
    >>> np.add.reduce(X, 2)
    array([[ 1,  5],
           [ 9, 13]])

    You can use the ``initial`` keyword argument to initialize the reduction with a
    different value.

    >>> np.add.reduce([10], initial=5)
    15
    >>> np.add.reduce(np.ones((2, 2, 2)), axis=(0, 2), initializer=10)
    array([14., 14.])

    Allows reductions of empty arrays where they would normally fail, i.e.
    for ufuncs without an identity.

    >>> np.minimum.reduce([], initial=np.inf)
    inf
    >>> np.minimum.reduce([])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity
    
    Unsigned integer type, compatible with C ``unsigned int``.
    
    add_docstring(obj, docstring)

    Add a docstring to a built-in obj if possible.
    If the obj already has a docstring raise a RuntimeError
    If this routine does not know how to add a docstring to the object
    raise a TypeError
    A 1-D view of the scalar.
    geterrobj()

    Return the current object that defines floating-point error handling.

    The error object contains all information that defines the error handling
    behavior in NumPy. `geterrobj` is used internally by the other
    functions that get and set error handling behavior (`geterr`, `seterr`,
    `geterrcall`, `seterrcall`).

    Returns
    -------
    errobj : list
        The error object, a list containing three elements:
        [internal numpy buffer size, error mask, error callback function].

        The error mask is a single integer that holds the treatment information
        on all four floating point errors. The information for each error type
        is contained in three bits of the integer. If we print it in base 8, we
        can see what treatment is set for "invalid", "under", "over", and
        "divide" (in that order). The printed string can be interpreted with

        * 0 : 'ignore'
        * 1 : 'warn'
        * 2 : 'raise'
        * 3 : 'call'
        * 4 : 'print'
        * 5 : 'log'

    See Also
    --------
    seterrobj, seterr, geterr, seterrcall, geterrcall
    getbufsize, setbufsize

    Notes
    -----
    For complete documentation of the types of floating-point exceptions and
    treatment options, see `seterr`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.geterrobj()  # first get the defaults
    [10000, 0, None]

    >>> def err_handler(type, flag):
    ...     print("Floating point error (%s), with flag %s" % (type, flag))
    ...
    >>> old_bufsize = np.setbufsize(20000)
    >>> old_err = np.seterr(divide='raise')
    >>> old_handler = np.seterrcall(err_handler)
    >>> np.geterrobj()
    [20000, 2, <function err_handler at 0x91dcaac>]

    >>> old_err = np.seterr(all='ignore')
    >>> np.base_repr(np.geterrobj()[1], 8)
    '0'
    >>> old_err = np.seterr(divide='warn', over='log', under='call',
                            invalid='print')
    >>> np.base_repr(np.geterrobj()[1], 8)
    '4351'

    
    Signed integer type, compatible with C ``long long``.
    
    Tuple ``(item_dtype, shape)`` if this `dtype` describes a sub-array, and
    None otherwise.

    The *shape* is the fixed shape of the sub-array described by this
    data type, and *item_dtype* the data type of the array.

    If a field whose dtype object has this attribute is retrieved,
    then the extra dimensions implied by *shape* are tacked on to
    the end of the retrieved array.

    
    Tuple of bytes to step in each dimension when traversing an array.

    The byte offset of element ``(i[0], i[1], ..., i[n])`` in an array `a`
    is::

        offset = sum(np.array(i) * a.strides)

    A more detailed explanation of strides can be found in the
    "ndarray.rst" file in the NumPy reference guide.

    Notes
    -----
    Imagine an array of 32-bit integers (each 4 bytes)::

      x = np.array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
                    [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]], dtype=np.int32)

    This array is stored in memory as 40 bytes, one after the other
    (known as a contiguous block of memory).  The strides of an array tell
    us how many bytes we have to skip in memory to move to the next position
    along a certain axis.  For example, we have to skip 4 bytes (1 value) to
    move to the next column, but 20 bytes (5 values) to get to the same
    position in the next row.  As such, the strides for the array `x` will be
    ``(20, 4)``.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided

    Examples
    --------
    >>> y = np.reshape(np.arange(2*3*4), (2,3,4))
    >>> y
    array([[[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
            [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
            [ 8,  9, 10, 11]],
           [[12, 13, 14, 15],
            [16, 17, 18, 19],
            [20, 21, 22, 23]]])
    >>> y.strides
    (48, 16, 4)
    >>> y[1,1,1]
    17
    >>> offset=sum(y.strides * np.array((1,1,1)))
    >>> offset/y.itemsize
    17

    >>> x = np.reshape(np.arange(5*6*7*8), (5,6,7,8)).transpose(2,3,1,0)
    >>> x.strides
    (32, 4, 224, 1344)
    >>> i = np.array([3,5,2,2])
    >>> offset = sum(i * x.strides)
    >>> x[3,5,2,2]
    813
    >>> offset / x.itemsize
    813

    
    Total bytes consumed by the elements of the array.

    Notes
    -----
    Does not include memory consumed by non-element attributes of the
    array object.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.zeros((3,5,2), dtype=np.complex128)
    >>> x.nbytes
    480
    >>> np.prod(x.shape) * x.itemsize
    480

    
    a.dot(b, out=None)

    Dot product of two arrays.

    Refer to `numpy.dot` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.dot : equivalent function

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.eye(2)
    >>> b = np.ones((2, 2)) * 2
    >>> a.dot(b)
    array([[ 2.,  2.],
           [ 2.,  2.]])

    This array method can be conveniently chained:

    >>> a.dot(b).dot(b)
    array([[ 8.,  8.],
           [ 8.,  8.]])

    
    Integer indicating how this dtype relates to the built-in dtypes.

    Read-only.

    =  ========================================================================
    0  if this is a structured array type, with fields
    1  if this is a dtype compiled into numpy (such as ints, floats etc)
    2  if the dtype is for a user-defined numpy type
       A user-defined type uses the numpy C-API machinery to extend
       numpy to handle a new array type. See
       :ref:`user.user-defined-data-types` in the NumPy manual.
    =  ========================================================================

    Examples
    --------
    >>> dt = np.dtype('i2')
    >>> dt.isbuiltin
    1
    >>> dt = np.dtype('f8')
    >>> dt.isbuiltin
    1
    >>> dt = np.dtype([('field1', 'f8')])
    >>> dt.isbuiltin
    0

     a.__array__(|dtype) -> reference if type unchanged, copy otherwise.

    Returns either a new reference to self if dtype is not given or a new array
    of provided data type if dtype is different from the current dtype of the
    array.

    
    copy()

    Get a copy of the iterator in its current state.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(10)
    >>> y = x + 1
    >>> it = np.nditer([x, y])
    >>> it.next()
    (array(0), array(1))
    >>> it2 = it.copy()
    >>> it2.next()
    (array(1), array(2))

    
    Bit-flags describing how this data type is to be interpreted.

    Bit-masks are in `numpy.core.multiarray` as the constants
    `ITEM_HASOBJECT`, `LIST_PICKLE`, `ITEM_IS_POINTER`, `NEEDS_INIT`,
    `NEEDS_PYAPI`, `USE_GETITEM`, `USE_SETITEM`. A full explanation
    of these flags is in C-API documentation; they are largely useful
    for user-defined data-types.

    
    newbyteorder(new_order='S')

    Return a new `dtype` with a different byte order.

    Changes are also made in all fields and sub-arrays of the data type.

    The `new_order` code can be any from the following:

    * 'S' - swap dtype from current to opposite endian
    * {'<', 'L'} - little endian
    * {'>', 'B'} - big endian
    * {'=', 'N'} - native order
    * {'|', 'I'} - ignore (no change to byte order)

    Parameters
    ----------
    new_order : str, optional
        Byte order to force; a value from the byte order specifications
        above.  The default value ('S') results in swapping the current
        byte order. The code does a case-insensitive check on the first
        letter of `new_order` for the alternatives above.  For example,
        any of 'B' or 'b' or 'biggish' are valid to specify big-endian.


    Returns
    -------
    new_dtype : dtype
        New `dtype` object with the given change to the byte order.

    alias_type
    arange([start,] stop[, step,], dtype=None)

    Return evenly spaced values within a given interval.

    Values are generated within the half-open interval ``[start, stop)``
    (in other words, the interval including `start` but excluding `stop`).
    For integer arguments the function is equivalent to the Python built-in
    `range` function, but returns an ndarray rather than a list.

    When using a non-integer step, such as 0.1, the results will often not
    be consistent.  It is better to use `numpy.linspace` for these cases.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : number, optional
        Start of interval.  The interval includes this value.  The default
        start value is 0.
    stop : number
        End of interval.  The interval does not include this value, except
        in some cases where `step` is not an integer and floating point
        round-off affects the length of `out`.
    step : number, optional
        Spacing between values.  For any output `out`, this is the distance
        between two adjacent values, ``out[i+1] - out[i]``.  The default
        step size is 1.  If `step` is specified as a position argument,
        `start` must also be given.
    dtype : dtype
        The type of the output array.  If `dtype` is not given, infer the data
        type from the other input arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    arange : ndarray
        Array of evenly spaced values.

        For floating point arguments, the length of the result is
        ``ceil((stop - start)/step)``.  Because of floating point overflow,
        this rule may result in the last element of `out` being greater
        than `stop`.

    See Also
    --------
    linspace : Evenly spaced numbers with careful handling of endpoints.
    ogrid: Arrays of evenly spaced numbers in N-dimensions.
    mgrid: Grid-shaped arrays of evenly spaced numbers in N-dimensions.

    array([3, 5])

    
    a.all(axis=None, out=None, keepdims=False)

    Returns True if all elements evaluate to True.

    datetime_data(dtype, /)

    Get information about the step size of a date or time type.

    The returned tuple can be passed as the second argument of `numpy.datetime64` and
    `numpy.timedelta64`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype : dtype
        The dtype object, which must be a `datetime64` or `timedelta64` type.

    Returns
    -------
    unit : str
        The :ref:`datetime unit <arrays.dtypes.dateunits>` on which this dtype
        is based.
    count : int
        The number of base units in a step.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> dt_25s = np.dtype('timedelta64[25s]')
    >>> np.datetime_data(dt_25s)
    ('s', 25)
    >>> np.array(10, dt_25s).astype('timedelta64[s]')
    array(250, dtype='timedelta64[s]')

    The result can be used to construct a datetime that uses the same units
    as a timedelta

    >>> np.datetime64('2010', np.datetime_data(dt_25s))
    numpy.datetime64('2010-01-01T00:00:00', '25s')

    Base object if memory is from some other object.

    Examples
    --------
    The base of an array that owns its memory is None:

    >>> x = np.array([1,2,3,4])
    >>> x.base is None
    True

    Slicing creates a view, whose memory is shared with x:

    >>> y = x[2:]
    >>> y.base is x
    True

    
    Number of dimensions of broadcasted result. Alias for `nd`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.12.0

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> y = np.array([[4], [5], [6]])
    >>> b = np.broadcast(x, y)
    >>> b.ndim
    2

    
    Complex number type composed of two extended-precision floating-point
    numbers.
    
    Abstract base class of all scalar types without predefined length.
    The actual size of these types depends on the specific `np.dtype`
    instantiation.
    
    
    a.choose(choices, out=None, mode='raise')

    Use an index array to construct a new array from a set of choices.

    Refer to `numpy.choose` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.choose : equivalent function

    
    A unique number for each of the 21 different built-in types.

    These are roughly ordered from least-to-most precision.

    
    Boolean indicating whether the dtype is a struct which maintains
    field alignment. This flag is sticky, so when combining multiple
    structs together, it is preserved and produces new dtypes which
    are also aligned.
    
    at(a, indices, b=None)

    Performs unbuffered in place operation on operand 'a' for elements
    specified by 'indices'. For addition ufunc, this method is equivalent to
    ``a[indices] += b``, except that results are accumulated for elements that
    are indexed more than once. For example, ``a[[0,0]] += 1`` will only
    increment the first element once because of buffering, whereas
    ``add.at(a, [0,0], 1)`` will increment the first element twice.

    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The array to perform in place operation on.
    indices : array_like or tuple
        Array like index object or slice object for indexing into first
        operand. If first operand has multiple dimensions, indices can be a
        tuple of array like index objects or slice objects.
    b : array_like
        Second operand for ufuncs requiring two operands. Operand must be
        broadcastable over first operand after indexing or slicing.

    Examples
    --------
    Set items 0 and 1 to their negative values:

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> np.negative.at(a, [0, 1])
    >>> print(a)
    array([-1, -2, 3, 4])

    Increment items 0 and 1, and increment item 2 twice:

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> np.add.at(a, [0, 1, 2, 2], 1)
    >>> print(a)
    array([2, 3, 5, 4])

    Add items 0 and 1 in first array to second array,
    and store results in first array:

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> b = np.array([1, 2])
    >>> np.add.at(a, [0, 1], b)
    >>> print(a)
    array([2, 4, 3, 4])

    
    Abstract base class of all floating-point scalar types.
    
    tobytesdocformat_float_OSprintf_g
    format_float_OSprintf_g(val, precision)

    Print a floating point scalar using the system's printf function,
    equivalent to:

        printf("%.*g", precision, val);

    for half/float/double, or replacing 'g' by 'Lg' for longdouble. This
    method is designed to help cross-validate the format_float_* methods.

    Parameters
    ----------
    val : python float or numpy floating scalar
        Value to format.

    precision : non-negative integer, optional
        Precision given to printf.

    Returns
    -------
    rep : string
        The string representation of the floating point value

    See Also
    --------
    format_float_scientific
    format_float_positional
    
    Shape of broadcasted result.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> y = np.array([[4], [5], [6]])
    >>> b = np.broadcast(x, y)
    >>> b.shape
    (3, 3)

    
    Signed integer type, compatible with C ``char``.
    
    a.transpose(*axes)

    Returns a view of the array with axes transposed.

    For a 1-D array, this has no effect. (To change between column and
    row vectors, first cast the 1-D array into a matrix object.)
    For a 2-D array, this is the usual matrix transpose.
    For an n-D array, if axes are given, their order indicates how the
    axes are permuted (see Examples). If axes are not provided and
    ``a.shape = (i[0], i[1], ... i[n-2], i[n-1])``, then
    ``a.transpose().shape = (i[n-1], i[n-2], ... i[1], i[0])``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    axes : None, tuple of ints, or `n` ints

     * None or no argument: reverses the order of the axes.

     * tuple of ints: `i` in the `j`-th place in the tuple means `a`'s
       `i`-th axis becomes `a.transpose()`'s `j`-th axis.

     * `n` ints: same as an n-tuple of the same ints (this form is
       intended simply as a "convenience" alternative to the tuple form)

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        View of `a`, with axes suitably permuted.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.T : Array property returning the array transposed.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> a
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4]])
    >>> a.transpose()
    array([[1, 3],
           [2, 4]])
    >>> a.transpose((1, 0))
    array([[1, 3],
           [2, 4]])
    >>> a.transpose(1, 0)
    array([[1, 3],
           [2, 4]])

    
    Functions that operate element by element on whole arrays.

    To see the documentation for a specific ufunc, use `info`.  For
    example, ``np.info(np.sin)``.  Because ufuncs are written in C
    (for speed) and linked into Python with NumPy's ufunc facility,
    Python's help() function finds this page whenever help() is called
    on a ufunc.

    A detailed explanation of ufuncs can be found in the docs for :ref:`ufuncs`.

    Calling ufuncs:
    ===============

    op(*x[, out], where=True, **kwargs)
    Apply `op` to the arguments `*x` elementwise, broadcasting the arguments.

    The broadcasting rules are:

    * Dimensions of length 1 may be prepended to either array.
    * Arrays may be repeated along dimensions of length 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *x : array_like
        Input arrays.
    out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
        Alternate array object(s) in which to put the result; if provided, it
        must have a shape that the inputs broadcast to. A tuple of arrays
        (possible only as a keyword argument) must have length equal to the
        number of outputs; use `None` for uninitialized outputs to be
        allocated by the ufunc.
    where : array_like, optional
        Values of True indicate to calculate the ufunc at that position, values
        of False indicate to leave the value in the output alone.  Note that if
        an uninitialized return array is created via the default ``out=None``,
        then the elements where the values are False will remain uninitialized.
    **kwargs
        For other keyword-only arguments, see the :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

    Returns
    -------
    r : ndarray or tuple of ndarray
        `r` will have the shape that the arrays in `x` broadcast to; if `out` is
        provided, it will be returned. If not, `r` will be allocated and
        may contain uninitialized values. If the function has more than one
        output, then the result will be a tuple of arrays.

    type_aliases_gen
    a.dumps()

    Returns the pickle of the array as a string.
    pickle.loads or numpy.loads will convert the string back to an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    remove_axis
    remove_axis(i)

    Removes axis `i` from the iterator. Requires that the flag "multi_index"
    be enabled.

    
    Number of dimensions of the sub-array if this data type describes a
    sub-array, and ``0`` otherwise.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13.0

    
    Total size of broadcasted result.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> y = np.array([[4], [5], [6]])
    >>> b = np.broadcast(x, y)
    >>> b.size
    9

    
    a.clip(min=None, max=None, out=None)

    Return an array whose values are limited to ``[min, max]``.
    One of max or min must be given.

    Refer to `numpy.clip` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.clip : equivalent function

    
    a.sum(axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, keepdims=False)

    Return the sum of the array elements over the given axis.

    Refer to `numpy.sum` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.sum : equivalent function

    
    Unsigned integer type, compatible with C ``unsigned long``.
    
    set_numeric_ops(op1=func1, op2=func2, ...)

    Set numerical operators for array objects.

    .. deprecated:: 1.16

        For the general case, use :c:func:`PyUFunc_ReplaceLoopBySignature`.
        For ndarray subclasses, define the ``__array_ufunc__`` method and
        override the relevant ufunc.

    Parameters
    ----------
    op1, op2, ... : callable
        Each ``op = func`` pair describes an operator to be replaced.
        For example, ``add = lambda x, y: np.add(x, y) % 5`` would replace
        addition by modulus 5 addition.

    Returns
    -------
    saved_ops : list of callables
        A list of all operators, stored before making replacements.

    Notes
    -----
    .. WARNING::
       Use with care!  Incorrect usage may lead to memory errors.

    A function replacing an operator cannot make use of that operator.
    For example, when replacing add, you may not use ``+``.  Instead,
    directly call ufuncs.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> def add_mod5(x, y):
    ...     return np.add(x, y) % 5
    ...
    >>> old_funcs = np.set_numeric_ops(add=add_mod5)

    >>> x = np.arange(12).reshape((3, 4))
    >>> x + x
    array([[0, 2, 4, 1],
           [3, 0, 2, 4],
           [1, 3, 0, 2]])

    >>> ignore = np.set_numeric_ops(**old_funcs) # restore operators

    .. versionadded:: 1.9.0
    frompyfunc(func, nin, nout)

    Takes an arbitrary Python function and returns a NumPy ufunc.

    Can be used, for example, to add broadcasting to a built-in Python
    function (see Examples section).

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : Python function object
        An arbitrary Python function.
    nin : int
        The number of input arguments.
    nout : int
        The number of objects returned by `func`.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ufunc
        Returns a NumPy universal function (``ufunc``) object.

    See Also
    --------
    vectorize : evaluates pyfunc over input arrays using broadcasting rules of numpy

    Notes
    -----
    The returned ufunc always returns PyObject arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    Use frompyfunc to add broadcasting to the Python function ``oct``:

    >>> oct_array = np.frompyfunc(oct, 1, 1)
    >>> oct_array(np.array((10, 30, 100)))
    array([012, 036, 0144], dtype=object)
    >>> np.array((oct(10), oct(30), oct(100))) # for comparison
    array(['012', '036', '0144'],
          dtype='|S4')

    Array protocol: Python side.cfloat
    The element size of this data-type object.

    For 18 of the 21 types this number is fixed by the data-type.
    For the flexible data-types, this number can be anything.

    
    a.diagonal(offset=0, axis1=0, axis2=1)

    Return specified diagonals. In NumPy 1.9 the returned array is a
    read-only view instead of a copy as in previous NumPy versions.  In
    a future version the read-only restriction will be removed.

    Refer to :func:`numpy.diagonal` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.diagonal : equivalent function

    The number of elements in the gentype.
    empty(shape, dtype=float, order='C')

    Return a new array of given shape and type, without initializing entries.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : int or tuple of int
        Shape of the empty array, e.g., ``(2, 3)`` or ``2``.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Desired output data-type for the array, e.g, `numpy.int8`. Default is
        `numpy.float64`.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional, default: 'C'
        Whether to store multi-dimensional data in row-major
        (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) order in
        memory.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of uninitialized (arbitrary) data of the given shape, dtype, and
        order.  Object arrays will be initialized to None.

    See Also
    --------
    empty_like : Return an empty array with shape and type of input.
    ones : Return a new array setting values to one.
    zeros : Return a new array setting values to zero.
    full : Return a new array of given shape filled with value.


    Notes
    -----
    `empty`, unlike `zeros`, does not set the array values to zero,
    and may therefore be marginally faster.  On the other hand, it requires
    the user to manually set all the values in the array, and should be
    used with caution.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.empty([2, 2])
    array([[ -9.74499359e+001,   6.69583040e-309],
           [  2.13182611e-314,   3.06959433e-309]])         #random

    >>> np.empty([2, 2], dtype=int)
    array([[-1073741821, -1067949133],
           [  496041986,    19249760]])                     #random

    
    scalar(dtype, obj)

    Return a new scalar array of the given type initialized with obj.

    This function is meant mainly for pickle support. `dtype` must be a
    valid data-type descriptor. If `dtype` corresponds to an object
    descriptor, then `obj` can be any object, otherwise `obj` must be a
    string. If `obj` is not given, it will be interpreted as None for object
    type and as zeros for all other types.

    
    Boolean indicating whether this dtype contains any reference-counted
    objects in any fields or sub-dtypes.

    Recall that what is actually in the ndarray memory representing
    the Python object is the memory address of that object (a pointer).
    Special handling may be required, and this attribute is useful for
    distinguishing data types that may contain arbitrary Python objects
    and data-types that won't.

    
    a.ravel([order])

    Return a flattened array.

    Refer to `numpy.ravel` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.ravel : equivalent function

    ndarray.flat : a flat iterator on the array.

    
    Returns a list with types grouped input->output.

    Data attribute listing the data-type "Domain-Range" groupings the ufunc can
    deliver. The data-types are given using the character codes.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.ufunc.ntypes

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.add.types
    ['??->?', 'bb->b', 'BB->B', 'hh->h', 'HH->H', 'ii->i', 'II->I', 'll->l',
    'LL->L', 'qq->q', 'QQ->Q', 'ff->f', 'dd->d', 'gg->g', 'FF->F', 'DD->D',

    'qq->q', 'QQ->Q', 'ff->f', 'dd->d', 'gg->g', 'FF->F', 'DD->D', 'GG->G',
    'OO->O']

    >>> np.exp.types
    ['f->f', 'd->d', 'g->g', 'F->F', 'D->D', 'G->G', 'O->O']

    ['bb->b', 'BB->B', 'hh->h', 'HH->H', 'ii->i', 'II->I', 'll->l', 'LL->L',
    'qq->q', 'QQ->Q', 'ff->f', 'dd->d', 'gg->g', 'OO->O']

    Get array data-descriptor.
    getbuffer(obj [,offset[, size]])

    Create a buffer object from the given object referencing a slice of
    length size starting at offset.

    Default is the entire buffer. A read-write buffer is attempted followed
    by a read-only buffer.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : object

    offset : int, optional

    size : int, optional

    Returns
    -------
    buffer_obj : buffer

    Examples
    --------
    >>> buf = np.getbuffer(np.ones(5), 1, 3)
    >>> len(buf)
    3
    >>> buf[0]
    '\x00'
    >>> buf
    <read-write buffer for 0x8af1e70, size 3, offset 1 at 0x8ba4ec0>

    
    Unsigned integer type, compatible with C ``unsigned char``.
    
    An object to simplify the interaction of the array with the ctypes
    module.

    This attribute creates an object that makes it easier to use arrays
    when calling shared libraries with the ctypes module. The returned
    object has, among others, data, shape, and strides attributes (see
    Notes below) which themselves return ctypes objects that can be used
    as arguments to a shared library.

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Returns
    -------
    c : Python object
        Possessing attributes data, shape, strides, etc.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.ctypeslib

    Notes
    -----
    Below are the public attributes of this object which were documented
    in "Guide to NumPy" (we have omitted undocumented public attributes,
    as well as documented private attributes):

    .. autoattribute:: numpy.core._internal._ctypes.data

    .. autoattribute:: numpy.core._internal._ctypes.shape

    .. autoattribute:: numpy.core._internal._ctypes.strides

    .. automethod:: numpy.core._internal._ctypes.data_as

    .. automethod:: numpy.core._internal._ctypes.shape_as

    .. automethod:: numpy.core._internal._ctypes.strides_as

    If the ctypes module is not available, then the ctypes attribute
    of array objects still returns something useful, but ctypes objects
    are not returned and errors may be raised instead. In particular,
    the object will still have the as parameter attribute which will
    return an integer equal to the data attribute.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import ctypes
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3]])
    >>> x.ctypes.data
    30439712
    >>> x.ctypes.data_as(ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_long))
    <ctypes.LP_c_long object at 0x01F01300>
    >>> x.ctypes.data_as(ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_long)).contents
    c_long(0)
    >>> x.ctypes.data_as(ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_longlong)).contents
    c_longlong(4294967296L)
    >>> x.ctypes.shape
    <numpy.core._internal.c_long_Array_2 object at 0x01FFD580>
    >>> x.ctypes.shape_as(ctypes.c_long)
    <numpy.core._internal.c_long_Array_2 object at 0x01FCE620>
    >>> x.ctypes.strides
    <numpy.core._internal.c_long_Array_2 object at 0x01FCE620>
    >>> x.ctypes.strides_as(ctypes.c_longlong)
    <numpy.core._internal.c_longlong_Array_2 object at 0x01F01300>

    
    The required alignment (bytes) of this data-type according to the compiler.

    More information is available in the C-API section of the manual.

    
    a.compress(condition, axis=None, out=None)

    Return selected slices of this array along given axis.

    Refer to `numpy.compress` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.compress : equivalent function

    _numerictypes_get_ndarray_c_version()

    Return the compile time NDARRAY_VERSION number.

    unsignedinteger
    Abstract base class of all unsigned integer scalar types.
    
    
    add_ufunc_docstring(ufunc, new_docstring)

    Replace the docstring for a ufunc with new_docstring.
    This method will only work if the current docstring for
    the ufunc is NULL. (At the C level, i.e. when ufunc->doc is NULL.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    ufunc : numpy.ufunc
        A ufunc whose current doc is NULL.
    new_docstring : string
        The new docstring for the ufunc.

    Notes
    -----
    This method allocates memory for new_docstring on
    the heap. Technically this creates a mempory leak, since this
    memory will not be reclaimed until the end of the program
    even if the ufunc itself is removed. However this will only
    be a problem if the user is repeatedly creating ufuncs with
    no documentation, adding documentation via add_newdoc_ufunc,
    and then throwing away the ufunc.
    
    Dictionary of named fields defined for this data type, or ``None``.

    The dictionary is indexed by keys that are the names of the fields.
    Each entry in the dictionary is a tuple fully describing the field::

      (dtype, offset[, title])

    Offset is limited to C int, which is signed and usually 32 bits.
    If present, the optional title can be any object (if it is a string
    or unicode then it will also be a key in the fields dictionary,
    otherwise it's meta-data). Notice also that the first two elements
    of the tuple can be passed directly as arguments to the ``ndarray.getfield``
    and ``ndarray.setfield`` methods.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.getfield, ndarray.setfield

    Examples
    --------
    >>> dt = np.dtype([('name', np.str_, 16), ('grades', np.float64, (2,))])
    >>> print(dt.fields)
    {'grades': (dtype(('float64',(2,))), 16), 'name': (dtype('|S16'), 0)}

    _reconstruct(subtype, shape, dtype)

    Construct an empty array. Used by Pickles.

    The array-protocol typestring of this data-type object.
    compare_chararrays(a, b, cmp_op, rstrip)

    Performs element-wise comparison of two string arrays using the
    comparison operator specified by `cmp_op`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : array_like
        Arrays to be compared.
    cmp_op : {"<", "<=", "==", ">=", ">", "!="}
        Type of comparison.
    rstrip : Boolean
        If True, the spaces at the end of Strings are removed before the comparison.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The output array of type Boolean with the same shape as a and b.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `cmp_op` is not valid.
    TypeError
        If at least one of `a` or `b` is a non-string array

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array(["a", "b", "cde"])
    >>> b = np.array(["a", "a", "dec"])
    >>> np.compare_chararrays(a, b, ">", True)
    array([False,  True, False])

    fixed_aliases
    Base class for numpy scalar types.

    Class from which most (all?) numpy scalar types are derived.  For
    consistency, exposes the same API as `ndarray`, despite many
    consequent attributes being either "get-only," or completely irrelevant.
    This is the class from which it is strongly suggested users should derive
    custom scalar types.

    
    Signed integer type, compatible with C ``short``.
    
    Unsigned integer type, compatible with C ``unsigned short``.
    This function is a compatibility alias for tobytes. Despite its name it returns bytes not strings.

    AxisError: axes_arg: axis -4 is out of bounds for array of dimension 3
    
    Ordered list of field names, or ``None`` if there are no fields.

    The names are ordered according to increasing byte offset. This can be
    used, for example, to walk through all of the named fields in offset order.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> dt = np.dtype([('name', np.str_, 16), ('grades', np.float64, (2,))])
    >>> dt.names

    numeric_type_aliases.<locals>.type_aliases_gen
    promote_types(type1, type2)

    Returns the data type with the smallest size and smallest scalar
    kind to which both ``type1`` and ``type2`` may be safely cast.
    The returned data type is always in native byte order.

    This function is symmetric, but rarely associative.

    Parameters
    ----------
    type1 : dtype or dtype specifier
        First data type.
    type2 : dtype or dtype specifier
        Second data type.

    Returns
    -------
    out : dtype
        The promoted data type.

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    Starting in NumPy 1.9, promote_types function now returns a valid string
    length when given an integer or float dtype as one argument and a string
    dtype as another argument. Previously it always returned the input string
    dtype, even if it wasn't long enough to store the max integer/float value
    converted to a string.

    The number of arguments.

    Data attribute containing the number of arguments the ufunc takes, including
    optional ones.

    Notes
    -----
    Typically this value will be one more than what you might expect because all
    ufuncs take  the optional "out" argument.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.add.nargs
    3
    >>> np.multiply.nargs
    3
    >>> np.power.nargs
    3
    >>> np.exp.nargs

    a.{name}(order='C')

    Construct Python bytes containing the raw data bytes in the array.

    Constructs Python bytes showing a copy of the raw contents of
    data memory. The bytes object can be produced in either 'C' or 'Fortran',
    or 'Any' order (the default is 'C'-order). 'Any' order means C-order
    unless the F_CONTIGUOUS flag in the array is set, in which case it
    means 'Fortran' order.

    {deprecated}

    Parameters
    ----------
    order : {{'C', 'F', None}}, optional
        Order of the data for multidimensional arrays:
        C, Fortran, or the same as for the original array.

    Returns

    c_einsum(subscripts, *operands, out=None, dtype=None, order='K',
           casting='safe')

    *This documentation shadows that of the native python implementation of the `einsum` function,
    except all references and examples related to the `optimize` argument (v 0.12.0) have been removed.*

    Evaluates the Einstein summation convention on the operands.

    Using the Einstein summation convention, many common multi-dimensional,
    linear algebraic array operations can be represented in a simple fashion.
    In *implicit* mode `einsum` computes these values.

    In *explicit* mode, `einsum` provides further flexibility to compute
    other array operations that might not be considered classical Einstein
    summation operations, by disabling, or forcing summation over specified
    subscript labels.

    See the notes and examples for clarification.

    Parameters
    ----------
    subscripts : str
        Specifies the subscripts for summation as comma separated list of
        subscript labels. An implicit (classical Einstein summation)
        calculation is performed unless the explicit indicator '->' is
        included as well as subscript labels of the precise output form.
    operands : list of array_like
        These are the arrays for the operation.
    out : ndarray, optional
        If provided, the calculation is done into this array.
    dtype : {data-type, None}, optional
        If provided, forces the calculation to use the data type specified.
        Note that you may have to also give a more liberal `casting`
        parameter to allow the conversions. Default is None.
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
        Controls the memory layout of the output. 'C' means it should
        be C contiguous. 'F' means it should be Fortran contiguous,
        'A' means it should be 'F' if the inputs are all 'F', 'C' otherwise.
        'K' means it should be as close to the layout as the inputs as
        is possible, including arbitrarily permuted axes.
        Default is 'K'.
    casting : {'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}, optional
        Controls what kind of data casting may occur.  Setting this to
        'unsafe' is not recommended, as it can adversely affect accumulations.

          * 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.
          * 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.
          * 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
          * 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,
            like float64 to float32, are allowed.
          * 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.

        Default is 'safe'.
    optimize : {False, True, 'greedy', 'optimal'}, optional
        Controls if intermediate optimization should occur. No optimization
        will occur if False and True will default to the 'greedy' algorithm.
        Also accepts an explicit contraction list from the ``np.einsum_path``
        function. See ``np.einsum_path`` for more details. Defaults to False.

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        The calculation based on the Einstein summation convention.

    See Also
    --------
    einsum_path, dot, inner, outer, tensordot, linalg.multi_dot

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    The Einstein summation convention can be used to compute
    many multi-dimensional, linear algebraic array operations. `einsum`
    provides a succinct way of representing these.

    A non-exhaustive list of these operations,
    which can be computed by `einsum`, is shown below along with examples:

    * Trace of an array, :py:func:`numpy.trace`.
    * Return a diagonal, :py:func:`numpy.diag`.
    * Array axis summations, :py:func:`numpy.sum`.
    * Transpositions and permutations, :py:func:`numpy.transpose`.
    * Matrix multiplication and dot product, :py:func:`numpy.matmul` :py:func:`numpy.dot`.
    * Vector inner and outer products, :py:func:`numpy.inner` :py:func:`numpy.outer`.
    * Broadcasting, element-wise and scalar multiplication, :py:func:`numpy.multiply`.
    * Tensor contractions, :py:func:`numpy.tensordot`.
    * Chained array operations, in efficient calculation order, :py:func:`numpy.einsum_path`.

    The subscripts string is a comma-separated list of subscript labels,
    where each label refers to a dimension of the corresponding operand.
    Whenever a label is repeated it is summed, so ``np.einsum('i,i', a, b)``
    is equivalent to :py:func:`np.inner(a,b) <numpy.inner>`. If a label
    appears only once, it is not summed, so ``np.einsum('i', a)`` produces a
    view of ``a`` with no changes. A further example ``np.einsum('ij,jk', a, b)``
    describes traditional matrix multiplication and is equivalent to
    :py:func:`np.matmul(a,b) <numpy.matmul>`. Repeated subscript labels in one
    operand take the diagonal. For example, ``np.einsum('ii', a)`` is equivalent
    to :py:func:`np.trace(a) <numpy.trace>`.

    In *implicit mode*, the chosen subscripts are important
    since the axes of the output are reordered alphabetically.  This
    means that ``np.einsum('ij', a)`` doesn't affect a 2D array, while
    ``np.einsum('ji', a)`` takes its transpose. Additionally,
    ``np.einsum('ij,jk', a, b)`` returns a matrix multiplication, while,
    ``np.einsum('ij,jh', a, b)`` returns the transpose of the
    multiplication since subscript 'h' precedes subscript 'i'.

    In *explicit mode* the output can be directly controlled by
    specifying output subscript labels.  This requires the
    identifier '->' as well as the list of output subscript labels.
    This feature increases the flexibility of the function since
    summing can be disabled or forced when required. The call
    ``np.einsum('i->', a)`` is like :py:func:`np.sum(a, axis=-1) <numpy.sum>`,
    and ``np.einsum('ii->i', a)`` is like :py:func:`np.diag(a) <numpy.diag>`.
    The difference is that `einsum` does not allow broadcasting by default.
    Additionally ``np.einsum('ij,jh->ih', a, b)`` directly specifies the
    order of the output subscript labels and therefore returns matrix
    multiplication, unlike the example above in implicit mode.

    To enable and control broadcasting, use an ellipsis.  Default
    NumPy-style broadcasting is done by adding an ellipsis
    to the left of each term, like ``np.einsum('...ii->...i', a)``.
    To take the trace along the first and last axes,
    you can do ``np.einsum('i...i', a)``, or to do a matrix-matrix
    product with the left-most indices instead of rightmost, one can do
    ``np.einsum('ij...,jk...->ik...', a, b)``.

    When there is only one operand, no axes are summed, and no output
    parameter is provided, a view into the operand is returned instead
    of a new array.  Thus, taking the diagonal as ``np.einsum('ii->i', a)``
    produces a view (changed in version 1.10.0).

    `einsum` also provides an alternative way to provide the subscripts
    and operands as ``einsum(op0, sublist0, op1, sublist1, ..., [sublistout])``.
    If the output shape is not provided in this format `einsum` will be
    calculated in implicit mode, otherwise it will be performed explicitly.
    The examples below have corresponding `einsum` calls with the two
    parameter methods.

    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    Views returned from einsum are now writeable whenever the input array
    is writeable. For example, ``np.einsum('ijk...->kji...', a)`` will now
    have the same effect as :py:func:`np.swapaxes(a, 0, 2) <numpy.swapaxes>`
    and ``np.einsum('ii->i', a)`` will return a writeable view of the diagonal
    of a 2D array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(25).reshape(5,5)
    >>> b = np.arange(5)
    >>> c = np.arange(6).reshape(2,3)

    Trace of a matrix:

    >>> np.einsum('ii', a)
    60
    >>> np.einsum(a, [0,0])
    60
    >>> np.trace(a)
    60

    Extract the diagonal (requires explicit form):

    >>> np.einsum('ii->i', a)
    array([ 0,  6, 12, 18, 24])
    >>> np.einsum(a, [0,0], [0])
    array([ 0,  6, 12, 18, 24])
    >>> np.diag(a)
    array([ 0,  6, 12, 18, 24])

    Sum over an axis (requires explicit form):

    >>> np.einsum('ij->i', a)
    array([ 10,  35,  60,  85, 110])
    >>> np.einsum(a, [0,1], [0])
    array([ 10,  35,  60,  85, 110])
    >>> np.sum(a, axis=1)
    array([ 10,  35,  60,  85, 110])

    For higher dimensional arrays summing a single axis can be done with ellipsis:

    >>> np.einsum('...j->...', a)
    array([ 10,  35,  60,  85, 110])
    >>> np.einsum(a, [Ellipsis,1], [Ellipsis])
    array([ 10,  35,  60,  85, 110])

    Checks whether the structured data type in 'dtype'
    has a simple layout, where all the fields are in order,
    and follow each other with no alignment padding.

    When this returns true, the dtype can be reconstructed
    from a list of the field names and dtypes with no additional
    dtype parameters.

    Duplicates the C `is_dtype_struct_simple_unaligned_layout` functio.

    Creates a string repr of the dtype, excluding the 'dtype()' part
    surrounding the object. This object may be a string, a list, or
    a dict depending on the nature of the dtype. This
    is the object passed as the first parameter to the dtype
    constructor, and if no additional constructor parameters are
    given, will reproduce the exact memory layout.

    Parameters
    ----------
    short : bool
        If true, this creates a shorter repr using 'kind' and 'itemsize', instead
        of the longer type name.

    include_align : bool
        If true, this includes the 'align=True' parameter
        inside the struct dtype construction dict when needed. Use this flag
        if you want a proper repr string without the 'dtype()' part around it.

        If false, this does not preserve the
        'align=True' parameter or sticky NPY_ALIGNED_STRUCT flag for
        struct arrays like the regular repr does, because the 'align'
        flag is not part of first dtype constructor parameter. This
        mode is intended for a full 'repr', where the 'align=True' is
        provided as the second parameter.

Conversion from ctypes to dtype.

In an ideal world, we could acheive this through the PEP3118 buffer protocol,
something like::

    def dtype_from_ctypes_type(t):
        # needed to ensure that the shape of `t` is within memoryview.format
        class DummyStruct(ctypes.Structure):
            _fields_ = [('a', t)]

        # empty to avoid memory allocation
        ctype_0 = (DummyStruct * 0)()
        mv = memoryview(ctype_0)

        # convert the struct, and slice back out the field
        return _dtype_from_pep3118(mv.format)['a']

Unfortunately, this fails because:

* ctypes cannot handle length-0 arrays with PEP3118 (bpo-32782)
* PEP3118 cannot represent unions, but both numpy and ctypes can
* ctypes cannot handle big-endian structs with PEP3118 (bpo-32780)

    A decorator class for recursive nested functions.
    Naive recursive nested functions hold a reference to themselves:

    def outer(*args):
        def stringify_leaky(arg0, *arg1):
            if len(arg1) > 0:
                return stringify_leaky(*arg1)  # <- HERE
            return str(arg0)
        stringify_leaky(*args)

    This design pattern creates a reference cycle that is difficult for a
    garbage collector to resolve. The decorator class prevents the
    cycle by passing the nested function in as an argument `self`:

    def outer(*args):
        @recursive
        def stringify(self, arg0, *arg1):
            if len(arg1) > 0:

        A pointer to the memory area of the array as a Python integer.
        This memory area may contain data that is not aligned, or not in correct
        byte-order. The memory area may not even be writeable. The array
        flags and data-type of this array should be respected when passing this
        attribute to arbitrary C-code to avoid trouble that can include Python
        crashing. User Beware! The value of this attribute is exactly the same
        as ``self._array_interface_['data'][0]``.

        Note that unlike `data_as`, a reference will not be kept to the array:
        code like ``ctypes.c_void_p((a + b).ctypes.data)`` will result in a
        pointer to a deallocated array, and should be spelt

    This is an internal utility function to replace calls to str.capitalize()
    such that we can avoid changing behavior with changing locales.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : str

    Returns
    -------
    capitalized : str

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.core.numerictypes import english_capitalize

     Apply English case rules to convert ASCII strings to all upper case.

    This is an internal utility function to replace calls to str.upper() such
    that we can avoid changing behavior with changing locales. In particular,
    Turkish has distinct dotted and dotless variants of the Latin letter "I" in
    both lowercase and uppercase. Thus, "i".upper() != "I" in a "tr" locale.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : str

    Returns
    -------

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.core.numerictypes import english_upper

    ''
    _all_chars Apply English case rules to convert ASCII strings to all lower case.

    This is an internal utility function to replace calls to str.lower() such
    that we can avoid changing behavior with changing locales. In particular,
    Turkish has distinct dotted and dotless variants of the Latin letter "I" in

Due to compatibility, numpy has a very large number of different naming
conventions for the scalar types (those subclassing from `numpy.generic`).
This file produces a convoluted set of dictionaries mapping names to types,
and sometimes other mappings too.

.. data:: allTypes
    A dictionary of names to types that will be exposed as attributes through
    ``np.core.numerictypes.*``

.. data:: sctypeDict
    Similar to `allTypes`, but maps a broader set of aliases to their types.

.. data:: sctypeNA
    NumArray-compatible names for the scalar types. Contains not only
    ``name: type`` mappings, but ``char: name`` mappings too.

    .. deprecated:: 1.16

.. data:: sctypes
    A dictionary keyed by a "type group" string, providing a list of types
    under that group.

    Format a floating-point scalar as a decimal string in positional notation.

    Provides control over rounding, trimming and padding. Uses and assumes
    IEEE unbiased rounding. Uses the "Dragon4" algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : python float or numpy floating scalar
        Value to format.
    precision : non-negative integer or None, optional
        Maximum number of digits to print. May be None if `unique` is
        `True`, but must be an integer if unique is `False`.
    unique : boolean, optional
        If `True`, use a digit-generation strategy which gives the shortest
        representation which uniquely identifies the floating-point number from
        other values of the same type, by judicious rounding. If `precision`
        was omitted, print out all necessary digits, otherwise digit generation
        is cut off after `precision` digits and the remaining value is rounded.
        If `False`, digits are generated as if printing an infinite-precision
        value and stopping after `precision` digits, rounding the remaining
        value.
    fractional : boolean, optional
        If `True`, the cutoff of `precision` digits refers to the total number
        of digits after the decimal point, including leading zeros.
        If `False`, `precision` refers to the total number of significant
        digits, before or after the decimal point, ignoring leading zeros.
    trim : one of 'k', '.', '0', '-', optional
        Controls post-processing trimming of trailing digits, as follows:

        * 'k' : keep trailing zeros, keep decimal point (no trimming)
        * '.' : trim all trailing zeros, leave decimal point
        * '0' : trim all but the zero before the decimal point. Insert the
          zero if it is missing.
        * '-' : trim trailing zeros and any trailing decimal point
    sign : boolean, optional
        Whether to show the sign for positive values.
    pad_left : non-negative integer, optional
        Pad the left side of the string with whitespace until at least that
        many characters are to the left of the decimal point.
    pad_right : non-negative integer, optional
        Pad the right side of the string with whitespace until at least that
        many characters are to the right of the decimal point.

    Set a Python function to be used when pretty printing arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : function or None
        Function to be used to pretty print arrays. The function should expect
        a single array argument and return a string of the representation of
        the array. If None, the function is reset to the default NumPy function
        to print arrays.
    repr : bool, optional
        If True (default), the function for pretty printing (``__repr__``)
        is set, if False the function that returns the default string
        representation (``__str__``) is set.

    See Also
    --------
    set_printoptions, get_printoptions

    Examples
    --------
    >>> def pprint(arr):
    ...     return 'HA! - What are you going to do now?'
    ...
    >>> np.set_string_function(pprint)
    >>> a = np.arange(10)
    >>> a
    HA! - What are you going to do now?
    >>> print(a)
    [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]

    We can reset the function to the default:

    >>> np.set_string_function(None)
    >>> a
    array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

    `repr` affects either pretty printing or normal string representation.
    Note that ``__repr__`` is still affected by setting ``__str__``
    because the width of each array element in the returned string becomes
    equal to the length of the result of ``__str__()``.

    >>> x = np.arange(4)
    >>> np.set_string_function(lambda x:'random', repr=False)
    >>> x.__str__()
    'random'
    >>> x.__repr__()

    Format a floating-point scalar as a decimal string in scientific notation.

    Provides control over rounding, trimming and padding. Uses and assumes
    IEEE unbiased rounding. Uses the "Dragon4" algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : python float or numpy floating scalar
        Value to format.
    precision : non-negative integer or None, optional

    unique : boolean, optional
        If `True`, use a digit-generation strategy which gives the shortest
        representation which uniquely identifies the floating-point number from
        other values of the same type, by judicious rounding. If `precision`
        was omitted, print all necessary digits, otherwise digit generation is
        cut off after `precision` digits and the remaining value is rounded.
        If `False`, digits are generated as if printing an infinite-precision
        value and stopping after `precision` digits, rounding the remaining
        value.
    trim : one of 'k', '.', '0', '-', optional
        Controls post-processing trimming of trailing digits, as follows:

        * 'k' : keep trailing zeros, keep decimal point (no trimming)
        * '.' : trim all trailing zeros, leave decimal point
        * '0' : trim all but the zero before the decimal point. Insert the
          zero if it is missing.
        * '-' : trim trailing zeros and any trailing decimal point
    sign : boolean, optional
        Whether to show the sign for positive values.
    pad_left : non-negative integer, optional
        Pad the left side of the string with whitespace until at least that
        many characters are to the left of the decimal point.
    exp_digits : non-negative integer, optional
        Pad the exponent with zeros until it contains at least this many digits.
        If omitted, the exponent will be at least 2 digits.

    Return a string representation of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    max_line_width : int, optional
        The maximum number of columns the string should span. Newline
        characters splits the string appropriately after array elements.
    precision : int or None, optional
        Floating point precision. Default is the current printing
        precision (usually 8), which can be altered using `set_printoptions`.
    suppress_small : bool, optional
        Represent very small numbers as zero. A number is "very small" if it
        is smaller than the current printing precision.
    separator : str, optional
        Inserted between elements.
    prefix : str, optional
    suffix: str, optional
        The length of the prefix and suffix strings are used to respectively
        align and wrap the output. An array is typically printed as::

          prefix + array2string(a) + suffix

        The output is left-padded by the length of the prefix string, and
        wrapping is forced at the column ``max_line_width - len(suffix)``.
        It should be noted that the content of prefix and suffix strings are
        not included in the output.
    style : _NoValue, optional
        Has no effect, do not use.

        .. deprecated:: 1.14.0
    formatter : dict of callables, optional
        If not None, the keys should indicate the type(s) that the respective
        formatting function applies to.  Callables should return a string.
        Types that are not specified (by their corresponding keys) are handled
        by the default formatters.  Individual types for which a formatter
        can be set are:

        - 'bool'
        - 'int'
        - 'timedelta' : a `numpy.timedelta64`
        - 'datetime' : a `numpy.datetime64`
        - 'float'
        - 'longfloat' : 128-bit floats
        - 'complexfloat'
        - 'longcomplexfloat' : composed of two 128-bit floats
        - 'void' : type `numpy.void`
        - 'numpystr' : types `numpy.string_` and `numpy.unicode_`
        - 'str' : all other strings

        Other keys that can be used to set a group of types at once are:

        - 'all' : sets all types
        - 'int_kind' : sets 'int'
        - 'float_kind' : sets 'float' and 'longfloat'
        - 'complex_kind' : sets 'complexfloat' and 'longcomplexfloat'
        - 'str_kind' : sets 'str' and 'numpystr'
    threshold : int, optional
        Total number of array elements which trigger summarization
        rather than full repr.
    edgeitems : int, optional
        Number of array items in summary at beginning and end of
        each dimension.
    sign : string, either '-', '+', or ' ', optional
        Controls printing of the sign of floating-point types. If '+', always
        print the sign of positive values. If ' ', always prints a space
        (whitespace character) in the sign position of positive values.  If
        '-', omit the sign character of positive values.
    floatmode : str, optional
        Controls the interpretation of the `precision` option for
        floating-point types. Can take the following values:

        - 'fixed': Always print exactly `precision` fractional digits,
          even if this would print more or fewer digits than
          necessary to specify the value uniquely.
        - 'unique': Print the minimum number of fractional digits necessary
          to represent each value uniquely. Different elements may
          have a different number of digits.  The value of the
          `precision` option is ignored.
        - 'maxprec': Print at most `precision` fractional digits, but if
          an element can be uniquely represented with fewer digits
          only print it with that many.
        - 'maxprec_equal': Print at most `precision` fractional digits,
          but if every element in the array can be uniquely
          represented with an equal number of fewer digits, use that
          many digits for all elements.
    legacy : string or `False`, optional
        If set to the string `'1.13'` enables 1.13 legacy printing mode. This
        approximates numpy 1.13 print output by including a space in the sign
        position of floats and different behavior for 0d arrays. If set to
        `False`, disables legacy mode. Unrecognized strings will be ignored
        with a warning for forward compatibility.

        .. versionadded:: 1.14.0

    Returns
    -------
    array_str : str
        String representation of the array.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        if a callable in `formatter` does not return a string.

    See Also
    --------
    array_str, array_repr, set_printoptions, get_printoptions

    Notes
    -----
    If a formatter is specified for a certain type, the `precision` keyword is
    ignored for that type.

    This is a very flexible function; `array_repr` and `array_str` are using
    `array2string` internally so keywords with the same name should work
    identically in all three functions.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1e-16,1,2,3])
    >>> print(np.array2string(x, precision=2, separator=',',
    ...                       suppress_small=True))

                to represent each value uniquely. Different elements may
                have a different number of digits. The value of the
                `precision` option is ignored.
        * 'maxprec': Print at most `precision` fractional digits, but if
                an element can be uniquely represented with fewer digits
                only print it with that many.
        * 'maxprec_equal': Print at most `precision` fractional digits,
                but if every element in the array can be uniquely
                represented with an equal number of fewer digits, use that
                many digits for all elements.
    legacy : string or `False`, optional
        If set to the string `'1.13'` enables 1.13 legacy printing mode. This
        approximates numpy 1.13 print output by including a space in the sign
        position of floats and different behavior for 0d arrays. If set to
        `False`, disables legacy mode. Unrecognized strings will be ignored
        with a warning for forward compatibility.

    Notes
    -----
    `formatter` is always reset with a call to `set_printoptions`.

    Examples
    --------
    Floating point precision can be set:

    >>> np.set_printoptions(precision=4)
    >>> print(np.array([1.123456789]))
    [ 1.1235]

    Long arrays can be summarised:

    >>> np.set_printoptions(threshold=5)
    >>> print(np.arange(10))
    [0 1 2 ..., 7 8 9]

    Small results can be suppressed:

    >>> eps = np.finfo(float).eps
    >>> x = np.arange(4.)
    >>> x**2 - (x + eps)**2
    array([ -4.9304e-32,  -4.4409e-16,   0.0000e+00,   0.0000e+00])
    >>> np.set_printoptions(suppress=True)
    >>> x**2 - (x + eps)**2
    array([-0., -0.,  0.,  0.])

    A custom formatter can be used to display array elements as desired:

    >>> np.set_printoptions(formatter={'all':lambda x: 'int: '+str(-x)})
    >>> x = np.arange(3)
    >>> x
    array([int: 0, int: -1, int: -2])
    >>> np.set_printoptions()  # formatter gets reset
    >>> x
    array([0, 1, 2])

    To put back the default options, you can use:

    >>> np.set_printoptions(edgeitems=3,infstr='inf',
    ... linewidth=75, nanstr='nan', precision=8,
    ... suppress=False, threshold=1000, formatter=None)
    StructuredVoidFormat.__call___leading_trailingStructuredVoidFormat.__init___array_repr_implementationdiscard
    Return a string representation of the data in an array.

    The data in the array is returned as a single string.  This function is
    similar to `array_repr`, the difference being that `array_repr` also
    returns information on the kind of array and its data type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input array.
    max_line_width : int, optional
        Inserts newlines if text is longer than `max_line_width`.  The
        default is, indirectly, 75.
    precision : int, optional
        Floating point precision.  Default is the current printing precision
        (usually 8), which can be altered using `set_printoptions`.
    suppress_small : bool, optional
        Represent numbers "very close" to zero as zero; default is False.
        Very close is defined by precision: if the precision is 8, e.g.,
        numbers smaller (in absolute value) than 5e-9 are represented as
        zero.

        --------
        mod
        
This module contains a set of functions for vectorized string
operations and methods.

.. note::
   The `chararray` class exists for backwards compatibility with
   Numarray, it is not recommended for new development. Starting from numpy
   1.4, if one needs arrays of strings, it is recommended to use arrays of
   `dtype` `object_`, `string_` or `unicode_`, and use the free functions
   in the `numpy.char` module for fast vectorized string operations.

Some methods will only be available if the corresponding string method is
available in your version of Python.

The preferred alias for `defchararray` is `numpy.char`.

chararray.__lt__chararray.isalphachararray.join
    Returns true for each element if all cased characters in the
    string are uppercase and there is at least one character, false
    otherwise.

    Call `str.isupper` element-wise.

    For 8-bit strings, this method is locale-dependent.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like of str or unicode

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Output array of bools

    See also
    --------
    str.isupper
    
    Create a `chararray`.

    .. note::
       This class is provided for numarray backward-compatibility.
       New code (not concerned with numarray compatibility) should use
       arrays of type `string_` or `unicode_` and use the free functions
       in :mod:`numpy.char <numpy.core.defchararray>` for fast
       vectorized string operations instead.

    Versus a regular NumPy array of type `str` or `unicode`, this
    class adds the following functionality:

      1) values automatically have whitespace removed from the end
         when indexed

      2) comparison operators automatically remove whitespace from the
         end when comparing values

      3) vectorized string operations are provided as methods
         (e.g. `str.endswith`) and infix operators (e.g. ``+, *, %``)

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : array of str or unicode-like

    itemsize : int, optional
        `itemsize` is the number of characters per scalar in the
        resulting array.  If `itemsize` is None, and `obj` is an
        object array or a Python list, the `itemsize` will be
        automatically determined.  If `itemsize` is provided and `obj`
        is of type str or unicode, then the `obj` string will be
        chunked into `itemsize` pieces.

    copy : bool, optional
        If true (default), then the object is copied.  Otherwise, a copy
        will only be made if __array__ returns a copy, if obj is a
        nested sequence, or if a copy is needed to satisfy any of the other
        requirements (`itemsize`, unicode, `order`, etc.).

    unicode : bool, optional
        When true, the resulting `chararray` can contain Unicode
        characters, when false only 8-bit characters.  If unicode is
        `None` and `obj` is one of the following:

          - a `chararray`,
          - an ndarray of type `str` or `unicode`
          - a Python str or unicode object,

        then the unicode setting of the output array will be
        automatically determined.

    order : {'C', 'F', 'A'}, optional
        Specify the order of the array.  If order is 'C' (default), then the
        array will be in C-contiguous order (last-index varies the
        fastest).  If order is 'F', then the returned array
        will be in Fortran-contiguous order (first-index varies the
        fastest).  If order is 'A', then the returned array may
        be in any order (either C-, Fortran-contiguous, or even
        discontiguous).
    
        For each element in `self`, return a copy with the trailing
        characters removed.

        See also
        --------
        char.rstrip

        chararray.__mod__chararray.islower
    Helper function for determining the output type of some string
    operations.

    For an operation on two ndarrays, if at least one is unicode, the
    result should be unicode.
    fillchar
        Calls `str.decode` element-wise.

        See also
        --------
        char.decode

        char.splitlines

        
        Return (other + self), that is string concatenation,

        See also
        --------
        add
        
    Return an array with the elements converted to uppercase.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray, {str, unicode}

    >>> np.char.upper(c)
    array(['A1B C', '1BCA', 'BCA1'],
        dtype='|S5')

    chararray.isspace
    For each element, return True if there are only decimal
    characters in the element.

    Calls `unicode.isdecimal` element-wise.

    Decimal characters include digit characters, and all characters
    that that can be used to form decimal-radix numbers,
    e.g. ``U+0660, ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ZERO``.

    arr1arr2
    chararray(shape, itemsize=1, unicode=False, buffer=None, offset=0,
              strides=None, order=None)

    Provides a convenient view on arrays of string and unicode values.

    .. note::
       The `chararray` class exists for backwards compatibility with
       Numarray, it is not recommended for new development. Starting from numpy
       1.4, if one needs arrays of strings, it is recommended to use arrays of
       `dtype` `object_`, `string_` or `unicode_`, and use the free functions
       in the `numpy.char` module for fast vectorized string operations.

    Versus a regular NumPy array of type `str` or `unicode`, this
    class adds the following functionality:

      1) values automatically have whitespace removed from the end
         when indexed

      2) comparison operators automatically remove whitespace from the
         end when comparing values

      3) vectorized string operations are provided as methods
         (e.g. `.endswith`) and infix operators (e.g. ``"+", "*", "%"``)

    chararrays should be created using `numpy.char.array` or
    `numpy.char.asarray`, rather than this constructor directly.

    This constructor creates the array, using `buffer` (with `offset`
    and `strides`) if it is not ``None``. If `buffer` is ``None``, then
    constructs a new array with `strides` in "C order", unless both
    ``len(shape) >= 2`` and ``order='Fortran'``, in which case `strides`
    is in "Fortran order".

        Length of each array element, in number of characters. Default is 1.
    unicode : bool, optional
        Are the array elements of type unicode (True) or string (False).
        Default is False.
    buffer : int, optional
        Memory address of the start of the array data.  Default is None,
        in which case a new array is created.
    offset : int, optional
        Fixed stride displacement from the beginning of an axis?
        Default is 0. Needs to be >=0.
    strides : array_like of ints, optional
        Strides for the array (see `ndarray.strides` for full description).
        Default is None.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
        The order in which the array data is stored in memory: 'C' ->
        "row major" order (the default), 'F' -> "column major"
        (Fortran) order.

        string and there is at least one character, false otherwise.

        See also
        --------
        char.istitle

        
    Helper function that returns the number of characters per field in
    a string or unicode array.  This is to abstract out the fact that
    for a unicode array this is itemsize / 4.
    chararray.rpartitionchararray.count
        Returns a boolean array which is `True` where the string element
        in `self` ends with `suffix`, otherwise `False`.

        See also
        --------
        char.endswith

        
    Convert the input to a `chararray`, copying the data only if
    necessary.

    Versus a regular NumPy array of type `str` or `unicode`, this
    class adds the following functionality:

      1) values automatically have whitespace removed from the end
         when indexed

      2) comparison operators automatically remove whitespace from the
         end when comparing values

      3) vectorized string operations are provided as methods
         (e.g. `str.endswith`) and infix operators (e.g. ``+``, ``*``,``%``)

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : array of str or unicode-like

    itemsize : int, optional
        `itemsize` is the number of characters per scalar in the
        resulting array.  If `itemsize` is None, and `obj` is an
        object array or a Python list, the `itemsize` will be
        automatically determined.  If `itemsize` is provided and `obj`
        is of type str or unicode, then the `obj` string will be
        chunked into `itemsize` pieces.

    unicode : bool, optional
        When true, the resulting `chararray` can contain Unicode
        characters, when false only 8-bit characters.  If unicode is
        `None` and `obj` is one of the following:

          - a `chararray`,
          - an ndarray of type `str` or 'unicode`
          - a Python str or unicode object,

        then the unicode setting of the output array will be
        automatically determined.

    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
        Specify the order of the array.  If order is 'C' (default), then the
        array will be in C-contiguous order (last-index varies the
        fastest).  If order is 'F', then the returned array
        will be in Fortran-contiguous order (first-index varies the
        fastest).
    chararray.expandtabs
    Returns true for each element if all characters in the string are
    alphanumeric and there is at least one character, false otherwise.

    Calls `str.isalnum` element-wise.

    For 8-bit strings, this method is locale-dependent.

Implementation of optimized einsum.


    einsum_path(subscripts, *operands, optimize='greedy')

    Evaluates the lowest cost contraction order for an einsum expression by
    considering the creation of intermediate arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    subscripts : str
        Specifies the subscripts for summation.
    *operands : list of array_like
        These are the arrays for the operation.
    optimize : {bool, list, tuple, 'greedy', 'optimal'}
        Choose the type of path. If a tuple is provided, the second argument is
        assumed to be the maximum intermediate size created. If only a single
        argument is provided the largest input or output array size is used
        as a maximum intermediate size.

        * if a list is given that starts with ``einsum_path``, uses this as the
          contraction path
        * if False no optimization is taken
        * if True defaults to the 'greedy' algorithm
        * 'optimal' An algorithm that combinatorially explores all possible
          ways of contracting the listed tensors and choosest the least costly
          path. Scales exponentially with the number of terms in the
          contraction.
        * 'greedy' An algorithm that chooses the best pair contraction
          at each step. Effectively, this algorithm searches the largest inner,
          Hadamard, and then outer products at each step. Scales cubically with
          the number of terms in the contraction. Equivalent to the 'optimal'
          path for most contractions.

        Default is 'greedy'.

    Returns
    -------
    path : list of tuples
        A list representation of the einsum path.
    string_repr : str
        A printable representation of the einsum path.

    Notes
    -----
    The resulting path indicates which terms of the input contraction should be
    contracted first, the result of this contraction is then appended to the
    end of the contraction list. This list can then be iterated over until all
    intermediate contractions are complete.

    See Also
    --------
    einsum, linalg.multi_dot

    Examples
    --------

    We can begin with a chain dot example. In this case, it is optimal to
    contract the ``b`` and ``c`` tensors first as represented by the first
    element of the path ``(1, 2)``. The resulting tensor is added to the end
    of the contraction and the remaining contraction ``(0, 1)`` is then
    completed.

    >>> a = np.random.rand(2, 2)
    >>> b = np.random.rand(2, 5)
    >>> c = np.random.rand(5, 2)

    Checks if we can use BLAS (np.tensordot) call and its beneficial to do so.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inputs : list of str
        Specifies the subscripts for summation.
    result : str
        Resulting summation.
    idx_removed : set

    Notes
    -----
    If the operations is BLAS level 1 or 2 and is not already aligned
    we default back to einsum as the memory movement to copy is more
    costly than the operation itself.


    Examples

    # Standard GEMM operation
    >>> _can_dot(['ij', 'jk'], 'ik', set('j'))
    True

    # Can use the standard BLAS, but requires odd data movement
    >>> _can_dot(['ijj', 'jk'], 'ik', set('j'))
    False

    einsum(subscripts, *operands, out=None, dtype=None, order='K',
           casting='safe', optimize=False)

    Evaluates the Einstein summation convention on the operands.

    Using the Einstein summation convention, many common multi-dimensional,
    linear algebraic array operations can be represented in a simple fashion.
    In *implicit* mode `einsum` computes these values.

    In *explicit* mode, `einsum` provides further flexibility to compute
    other array operations that might not be considered classical Einstein
    summation operations, by disabling, or forcing summation over specified
    subscript labels.

    See the notes and examples for clarification.

    Parameters
    ----------
    subscripts : str
        Specifies the subscripts for summation as comma separated list of
        subscript labels. An implicit (classical Einstein summation)
        calculation is performed unless the explicit indicator '->' is
        included as well as subscript labels of the precise output form.
    operands : list of array_like
        These are the arrays for the operation.
    out : ndarray, optional
        If provided, the calculation is done into this array.
    dtype : {data-type, None}, optional
        If provided, forces the calculation to use the data type specified.
        Note that you may have to also give a more liberal `casting`
        parameter to allow the conversions. Default is None.
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
        Controls the memory layout of the output. 'C' means it should
        be C contiguous. 'F' means it should be Fortran contiguous,
        'A' means it should be 'F' if the inputs are all 'F', 'C' otherwise.
        'K' means it should be as close to the layout as the inputs as
        is possible, including arbitrarily permuted axes.
        Default is 'K'.
    casting : {'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}, optional
        Controls what kind of data casting may occur.  Setting this to
        'unsafe' is not recommended, as it can adversely affect accumulations.

          * 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.
          * 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.
          * 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
          * 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,
            like float64 to float32, are allowed.
          * 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.

        Default is 'safe'.
    optimize : {False, True, 'greedy', 'optimal'}, optional
        Controls if intermediate optimization should occur. No optimization
        will occur if False and True will default to the 'greedy' algorithm.
        Also accepts an explicit contraction list from the ``np.einsum_path``
        function. See ``np.einsum_path`` for more details. Defaults to False.

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        The calculation based on the Einstein summation convention.

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    The Einstein summation convention can be used to compute
    many multi-dimensional, linear algebraic array operations. `einsum`
    provides a succinct way of representing these.

    A non-exhaustive list of these operations,
    which can be computed by `einsum`, is shown below along with examples:

    * Trace of an array, :py:func:`numpy.trace`.
    * Return a diagonal, :py:func:`numpy.diag`.
    * Array axis summations, :py:func:`numpy.sum`.
    * Transpositions and permutations, :py:func:`numpy.transpose`.
    * Matrix multiplication and dot product, :py:func:`numpy.matmul` :py:func:`numpy.dot`.
    * Vector inner and outer products, :py:func:`numpy.inner` :py:func:`numpy.outer`.
    * Broadcasting, element-wise and scalar multiplication, :py:func:`numpy.multiply`.
    * Tensor contractions, :py:func:`numpy.tensordot`.
    * Chained array operations, in efficient calculation order, :py:func:`numpy.einsum_path`.

    The subscripts string is a comma-separated list of subscript labels,
    where each label refers to a dimension of the corresponding operand.
    Whenever a label is repeated it is summed, so ``np.einsum('i,i', a, b)``
    is equivalent to :py:func:`np.inner(a,b) <numpy.inner>`. If a label
    appears only once, it is not summed, so ``np.einsum('i', a)`` produces a
    view of ``a`` with no changes. A further example ``np.einsum('ij,jk', a, b)``
    describes traditional matrix multiplication and is equivalent to
    :py:func:`np.matmul(a,b) <numpy.matmul>`. Repeated subscript labels in one
    operand take the diagonal. For example, ``np.einsum('ii', a)`` is equivalent
    to :py:func:`np.trace(a) <numpy.trace>`.

    In *implicit mode*, the chosen subscripts are important
    since the axes of the output are reordered alphabetically.  This
    means that ``np.einsum('ij', a)`` doesn't affect a 2D array, while
    ``np.einsum('ji', a)`` takes its transpose. Additionally,
    ``np.einsum('ij,jk', a, b)`` returns a matrix multiplication, while,
    ``np.einsum('ij,jh', a, b)`` returns the transpose of the
    multiplication since subscript 'h' precedes subscript 'i'.

    In *explicit mode* the output can be directly controlled by
    specifying output subscript labels.  This requires the
    identifier '->' as well as the list of output subscript labels.
    This feature increases the flexibility of the function since
    summing can be disabled or forced when required. The call
    ``np.einsum('i->', a)`` is like :py:func:`np.sum(a, axis=-1) <numpy.sum>`,
    and ``np.einsum('ii->i', a)`` is like :py:func:`np.diag(a) <numpy.diag>`.
    The difference is that `einsum` does not allow broadcasting by default.
    Additionally ``np.einsum('ij,jh->ih', a, b)`` directly specifies the
    order of the output subscript labels and therefore returns matrix
    multiplication, unlike the example above in implicit mode.

    To enable and control broadcasting, use an ellipsis.  Default
    NumPy-style broadcasting is done by adding an ellipsis
    to the left of each term, like ``np.einsum('...ii->...i', a)``.
    To take the trace along the first and last axes,
    you can do ``np.einsum('i...i', a)``, or to do a matrix-matrix
    product with the left-most indices instead of rightmost, one can do
    ``np.einsum('ij...,jk...->ik...', a, b)``.

    When there is only one operand, no axes are summed, and no output
    parameter is provided, a view into the operand is returned instead
    of a new array.  Thus, taking the diagonal as ``np.einsum('ii->i', a)``
    produces a view (changed in version 1.10.0).

    `einsum` also provides an alternative way to provide the subscripts
    and operands as ``einsum(op0, sublist0, op1, sublist1, ..., [sublistout])``.
    If the output shape is not provided in this format `einsum` will be
    calculated in implicit mode, otherwise it will be performed explicitly.
    The examples below have corresponding `einsum` calls with the two
    parameter methods.

    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    Views returned from einsum are now writeable whenever the input array
    is writeable. For example, ``np.einsum('ijk...->kji...', a)`` will now
    have the same effect as :py:func:`np.swapaxes(a, 0, 2) <numpy.swapaxes>`
    and ``np.einsum('ii->i', a)`` will return a writeable view of the diagonal
    of a 2D array.

    .. versionadded:: 1.12.0

    Added the ``optimize`` argument which will optimize the contraction order
    of an einsum expression. For a contraction with three or more operands this
    can greatly increase the computational efficiency at the cost of a larger
    memory footprint during computation.

    Typically a 'greedy' algorithm is applied which empirical tests have shown
    returns the optimal path in the majority of cases. In some cases 'optimal'
    will return the superlative path through a more expensive, exhaustive search.
    For iterative calculations it may be advisable to calculate the optimal path
    once and reuse that path by supplying it as an argument. An example is given
    below.

    See :py:func:`numpy.einsum_path` for more details.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(25).reshape(5,5)
    >>> b = np.arange(5)
    >>> c = np.arange(6).reshape(2,3)

    Trace of a matrix:

    >>> np.einsum('ii', a)
    60
    >>> np.einsum(a, [0,0])
    60
    >>> np.trace(a)
    60

    Extract the diagonal (requires explicit form):

    >>> np.einsum('ii->i', a)
    array([ 0,  6, 12, 18, 24])
    >>> np.einsum(a, [0,0], [0])
    array([ 0,  6, 12, 18, 24])
    >>> np.diag(a)
    array([ 0,  6, 12, 18, 24])

    Sum over an axis (requires explicit form):

    >>> np.einsum('ij->i', a)
    array([ 10,  35,  60,  85, 110])
    >>> np.einsum(a, [0,1], [0])
    array([ 10,  35,  60,  85, 110])
    >>> np.sum(a, axis=1)
    array([ 10,  35,  60,  85, 110])

    For higher dimensional arrays summing a single axis can be done with ellipsis:

    >>> np.einsum('...j->...', a)
    array([ 10,  35,  60,  85, 110])
    >>> np.einsum(a, [Ellipsis,1], [Ellipsis])
    array([ 10,  35,  60,  85, 110])

    Compute a matrix transpose, or reorder any number of axes:

    >>> np.einsum('ji', c)
    array([[0, 3],
           [1, 4],
           [2, 5]])
    >>> np.einsum('ij->ji', c)
    array([[0, 3],
           [1, 4],
           [2, 5]])
    >>> np.einsum(c, [1,0])
    array([[0, 3],
           [1, 4],
           [2, 5]])
    >>> np.transpose(c)
    array([[0, 3],
           [1, 4],
           [2, 5]])

    Vector inner products:

    >>> np.einsum('i,i', b, b)
    30
    >>> np.einsum(b, [0], b, [0])
    30
    >>> np.inner(b,b)
    30

    Matrix vector multiplication:

    >>> np.einsum('ij,j', a, b)
    array([ 30,  80, 130, 180, 230])
    >>> np.einsum(a, [0,1], b, [1])
    array([ 30,  80, 130, 180, 230])
    >>> np.dot(a, b)
    array([ 30,  80, 130, 180, 230])
    >>> np.einsum('...j,j', a, b)
    array([ 30,  80, 130, 180, 230])

    Broadcasting and scalar multiplication:

    >>> np.einsum('..., ...', 3, c)
    array([[ 0,  3,  6],
           [ 9, 12, 15]])
    >>> np.einsum(',ij', 3, c)
    array([[ 0,  3,  6],
           [ 9, 12, 15]])
    >>> np.einsum(3, [Ellipsis], c, [Ellipsis])
    array([[ 0,  3,  6],
           [ 9, 12, 15]])
    >>> np.multiply(3, c)
    array([[ 0,  3,  6],
           [ 9, 12, 15]])

    Vector outer product:

    >>> np.einsum('i,j', np.arange(2)+1, b)
    array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
           [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]])
    >>> np.einsum(np.arange(2)+1, [0], b, [1])
    array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
           [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]])
    >>> np.outer(np.arange(2)+1, b)
    array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
           [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]])

    Tensor contraction:

    >>> a = np.arange(60.).reshape(3,4,5)
    >>> b = np.arange(24.).reshape(4,3,2)
    >>> np.einsum('ijk,jil->kl', a, b)
    array([[ 4400.,  4730.],
           [ 4532.,  4874.],
           [ 4664.,  5018.],
           [ 4796.,  5162.],
           [ 4928.,  5306.]])
    >>> np.einsum(a, [0,1,2], b, [1,0,3], [2,3])
    array([[ 4400.,  4730.],
           [ 4532.,  4874.],
           [ 4664.,  5018.],
           [ 4796.,  5162.],
           [ 4928.,  5306.]])
    >>> np.tensordot(a,b, axes=([1,0],[0,1]))
    array([[ 4400.,  4730.],
           [ 4532.,  4874.],
           [ 4664.,  5018.],
           [ 4796.,  5162.],
           [ 4928.,  5306.]])

    Writeable returned arrays (since version 1.10.0):

    >>> a = np.zeros((3, 3))
    >>> np.einsum('ii->i', a)[:] = 1
    >>> a
    array([[ 1.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  1.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0.,  1.]])

    Example of ellipsis use:

    >>> a = np.arange(6).reshape((3,2))
    >>> b = np.arange(12).reshape((4,3))
    >>> np.einsum('ki,jk->ij', a, b)
    array([[10, 28, 46, 64],
           [13, 40, 67, 94]])
    >>> np.einsum('ki,...k->i...', a, b)
    array([[10, 28, 46, 64],
           [13, 40, 67, 94]])
    >>> np.einsum('k...,jk', a, b)
    array([[10, 28, 46, 64],
           [13, 40, 67, 94]])

    Chained array operations. For more complicated contractions, speed ups
    might be achieved by repeatedly computing a 'greedy' path or pre-computing the
    'optimal' path and repeatedly applying it, using an
    `einsum_path` insertion (since version 1.12.0). Performance improvements can be
    particularly significant with larger arrays:

    >>> a = np.ones(64).reshape(2,4,8)
    # Basic `einsum`: ~1520ms  (benchmarked on 3.1GHz Intel i5.)
    >>> for iteration in range(500):
    ...     np.einsum('ijk,ilm,njm,nlk,abc->',a,a,a,a,a)
    # Sub-optimal `einsum` (due to repeated path calculation time): ~330ms
    >>> for iteration in range(500):
    ...     np.einsum('ijk,ilm,njm,nlk,abc->',a,a,a,a,a, optimize='optimal')
    # Greedy `einsum` (faster optimal path approximation): ~160ms
    >>> for iteration in range(500):
    ...     np.einsum('ijk,ilm,njm,nlk,abc->',a,a,a,a,a, optimize='greedy')
    # Optimal `einsum` (best usage pattern in some use cases): ~110ms
    >>> path = np.einsum_path('ijk,ilm,njm,nlk,abc->',a,a,a,a,a, optimize='optimal')[0]
    >>> for iteration in range(500):
    ...     np.einsum('ijk,ilm,njm,nlk,abc->',a,a,a,a,a, optimize=path)

    Ellipses lengths do not match.Size of label '%s' for operand %d (%d) does not match previous terms (%d).Did not understand the path: %s
    Finds the path by contracting the best pair until the input list is
    exhausted. The best pair is found by minimizing the tuple
    ``(-prod(indices_removed), cost)``.  What this amounts to is prioritizing
    matrix multiplication or inner product operations, then Hadamard like
    operations, and finally outer operations. Outer products are limited by
    ``memory_limit``. This algorithm scales cubically with respect to the
    number of elements in the list ``input_sets``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_sets : list
        List of sets that represent the lhs side of the einsum subscript
    output_set : set
        Set that represents the rhs side of the overall einsum subscript
    idx_dict : dictionary
        Dictionary of index sizes
    memory_limit_limit : int
        The maximum number of elements in a temporary array

    Returns
    -------
    path : list
        The greedy contraction order within the memory limit constraint.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> isets = [set('abd'), set('ac'), set('bdc')]
    >>> oset = set()
    >>> idx_sizes = {'a': 1, 'b':2, 'c':3, 'd':4}

    _transpose_dispatcher_ptp_dispatcher_cumsum_dispatcher
    Remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        Selects a subset of the single-dimensional entries in the
        shape. If an axis is selected with shape entry greater than
        one, an error is raised.

    Returns
    -------
    squeezed : ndarray
        The input array, but with all or a subset of the
        dimensions of length 1 removed. This is always `a` itself
        or a view into `a`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `axis` is not `None`, and an axis being squeezed is not of length 1

    Calling np.sum(generator) is deprecated, and in the future will give a different result. Use np.sum(np.fromiter(generator)) or the python sum builtin instead._repeat_dispatcher
    Interchange two axes of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis1 : int
        First axis.
    axis2 : int
        Second axis.

    Returns
    -------
    a_swapped : ndarray
        For NumPy >= 1.10.0, if `a` is an ndarray, then a view of `a` is
        returned; otherwise a new array is created. For earlier NumPy
        versions a view of `a` is returned only if the order of the
        axes is changed, otherwise the input array is returned.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[1,2,3]])
    >>> np.swapaxes(x,0,1)
    array([[1],
           [2],
           [3]])

    >>> x = np.array([[[0,1],[2,3]],[[4,5],[6,7]]])
    >>> x
    array([[[0, 1],
            [2, 3]],
           [[4, 5],
            [6, 7]]])

    >>> np.swapaxes(x,0,2)
    array([[[0, 4],
            [2, 6]],
           [[1, 5],
            [3, 7]]])

    
    Return the cumulative product over the given axis.

    See Also
    --------
    cumprod : equivalent function; see for details.
    
    Sum of array elements over a given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Elements to sum.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which a sum is performed.  The default,
        axis=None, will sum all of the elements of the input array.  If
        axis is negative it counts from the last to the first axis.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If axis is a tuple of ints, a sum is performed on all of the axes
        specified in the tuple instead of a single axis or all the axes as
        before.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        The type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed.  The dtype of `a` is used by default unless `a`
        has an integer dtype of less precision than the default platform
        integer.  In that case, if `a` is signed then the platform integer
        is used while if `a` is unsigned then an unsigned integer of the
        same precision as the platform integer is used.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape as the expected output, but the type of the output
        values will be cast if necessary.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `sum` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.
    initial : scalar, optional
        Starting value for the sum. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

    Returns
    -------
    sum_along_axis : ndarray
        An array with the same shape as `a`, with the specified
        axis removed.   If `a` is a 0-d array, or if `axis` is None, a scalar
        is returned.  If an output array is specified, a reference to
        `out` is returned.

    --------
    ndarray.sum : Equivalent method.

    cumsum : Cumulative sum of array elements.

    trapz : Integration of array values using the composite trapezoidal rule.

    mean, average

    Notes
    -----
    Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is
    raised on overflow.

    The sum of an empty array is the neutral element 0:

    >>> np.sum([])
    0.0

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.sum([0.5, 1.5])
    2.0
    >>> np.sum([0.5, 0.7, 0.2, 1.5], dtype=np.int32)
    1
    >>> np.sum([[0, 1], [0, 5]])
    6
    >>> np.sum([[0, 1], [0, 5]], axis=0)
    array([0, 6])
    >>> np.sum([[0, 1], [0, 5]], axis=1)
    array([1, 5])

    If the accumulator is too small, overflow occurs:

    >>> np.ones(128, dtype=np.int8).sum(dtype=np.int8)
    -128

    You can also start the sum with a value other than zero:

    >>> np.sum([10], initial=5)
    15
    
    Take elements from an array along an axis.

    When axis is not None, this function does the same thing as "fancy"
    indexing (indexing arrays using arrays); however, it can be easier to use
    if you need elements along a given axis. A call such as
    ``np.take(arr, indices, axis=3)`` is equivalent to
    ``arr[:,:,:,indices,...]``.

    Explained without fancy indexing, this is equivalent to the following use
    of `ndindex`, which sets each of ``ii``, ``jj``, and ``kk`` to a tuple of
    indices::

        Ni, Nk = a.shape[:axis], a.shape[axis+1:]
        Nj = indices.shape
        for ii in ndindex(Ni):
            for jj in ndindex(Nj):
                for kk in ndindex(Nk):
                    out[ii + jj + kk] = a[ii + (indices[jj],) + kk]

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like (Ni..., M, Nk...)
        The source array.
    indices : array_like (Nj...)
        The indices of the values to extract.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

        Also allow scalars for indices.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis over which to select values. By default, the flattened
        input array is used.
    out : ndarray, optional (Ni..., Nj..., Nk...)
        If provided, the result will be placed in this array. It should
        be of the appropriate shape and dtype.
    mode : {'raise', 'wrap', 'clip'}, optional
        Specifies how out-of-bounds indices will behave.

        * 'raise' -- raise an error (default)
        * 'wrap' -- wrap around
        * 'clip' -- clip to the range

        'clip' mode means that all indices that are too large are replaced
        by the index that addresses the last element along that axis. Note
        that this disables indexing with negative numbers.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray (Ni..., Nj..., Nk...)
        The returned array has the same type as `a`.

    See Also
    --------
    compress : Take elements using a boolean mask
    ndarray.take : equivalent method
    take_along_axis : Take elements by matching the array and the index arrays

    Notes
    -----

    By eliminating the inner loop in the description above, and using `s_` to
    build simple slice objects, `take` can be expressed  in terms of applying
    fancy indexing to each 1-d slice::

        Ni, Nk = a.shape[:axis], a.shape[axis+1:]
        for ii in ndindex(Ni):
            for kk in ndindex(Nj):
                out[ii + s_[...,] + kk] = a[ii + s_[:,] + kk][indices]

    For this reason, it is equivalent to (but faster than) the following use
    of `apply_along_axis`::

        out = np.apply_along_axis(lambda a_1d: a_1d[indices], axis, a)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = [4, 3, 5, 7, 6, 8]
    >>> indices = [0, 1, 4]
    >>> np.take(a, indices)
    array([4, 3, 6])

    In this example if `a` is an ndarray, "fancy" indexing can be used.

    >>> a = np.array(a)
    >>> a[indices]
    array([4, 3, 6])

    If `indices` is not one dimensional, the output also has these dimensions.

    >>> np.take(a, [[0, 1], [2, 3]])
    array([[4, 3],
           [5, 7]])
    _argmax_dispatchercumproduct_alen_dispathcer
    Return the cumulative product of elements along a given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the cumulative product is computed.  By default
        the input is flattened.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type of the returned array, as well as of the accumulator in which
        the elements are multiplied.  If *dtype* is not specified, it
        defaults to the dtype of `a`, unless `a` has an integer dtype with
        a precision less than that of the default platform integer.  In
        that case, the default platform integer is used instead.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output
        but the type of the resulting values will be cast if necessary.

    Returns
    -------
    cumprod : ndarray
        A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is
        specified, in which case a reference to out is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.doc.ufuncs : Section "Output arguments"

    Notes
    -----
    Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is
    raised on overflow.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([1,2,3])
    >>> np.cumprod(a) # intermediate results 1, 1*2
    ...               # total product 1*2*3 = 6
    array([1, 2, 6])
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> np.cumprod(a, dtype=float) # specify type of output
    array([   1.,    2.,    6.,   24.,  120.,  720.])

    The cumulative product for each column (i.e., over the rows) of `a`:

    >>> np.cumprod(a, axis=0)
    array([[ 1,  2,  3],
           [ 4, 10, 18]])

    The cumulative product for each row (i.e. over the columns) of `a`:

    >>> np.cumprod(a,axis=1)
    array([[  1,   2,   6],
           [  4,  20, 120]])

    
    Range of values (maximum - minimum) along an axis.

    The name of the function comes from the acronym for 'peak to peak'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input values.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis along which to find the peaks.  By default, flatten the
        array.  `axis` may be negative, in
        which case it counts from the last to the first axis.

        .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

        If this is a tuple of ints, a reduction is performed on multiple
        axes, instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    out : array_like
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
        but the type of the output values will be cast if necessary.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `ptp` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    ptp : ndarray
        A new array holding the result, unless `out` was
        specified, in which case a reference to `out` is returned.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(4).reshape((2,2))
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3]])

    >>> np.ptp(x, axis=0)
    array([2, 2])

    >>> np.ptp(x, axis=1)
    array([1, 1])

    passkwargs
    Repeat elements of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    repeats : int or array of ints
        The number of repetitions for each element.  `repeats` is broadcasted
        to fit the shape of the given axis.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which to repeat values.  By default, use the
        flattened input array, and return a flat output array.

    Returns
    -------
    repeated_array : ndarray
        Output array which has the same shape as `a`, except along
        the given axis.

    See Also
    --------
    tile : Tile an array.

    Examples
    --------

    array([3, 3, 3, 3])
    >>> x = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
    >>> np.repeat(x, 2)
    array([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4])

           [3, 4],
           [3, 4]])

    
    Return the cumulative sum of the elements along a given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the cumulative sum is computed. The default
        (None) is to compute the cumsum over the flattened array.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed.  If `dtype` is not specified, it defaults
        to the dtype of `a`, unless `a` has an integer dtype with a
        precision less than that of the default platform integer.  In
        that case, the default platform integer is used.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output
        but the type will be cast if necessary. See `doc.ufuncs`
        (Section "Output arguments") for more details.

    Returns
    -------
    cumsum_along_axis : ndarray.
        A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is
        specified, in which case a reference to `out` is returned. The
        result has the same size as `a`, and the same shape as `a` if
        `axis` is not None or `a` is a 1-d array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
    >>> a
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> np.cumsum(a)
    array([ 1,  3,  6, 10, 15, 21])
    >>> np.cumsum(a, dtype=float)     # specifies type of output value(s)
    array([  1.,   3.,   6.,  10.,  15.,  21.])

    >>> np.cumsum(a,axis=0)      # sum over rows for each of the 3 columns
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [5, 7, 9]])
    >>> np.cumsum(a,axis=1)      # sum over columns for each of the 2 rows
    array([[ 1,  3,  6],
           [ 4,  9, 15]])

    _ravel_dispatcher
    Return the indices of the elements that are non-zero.

    Returns a tuple of arrays, one for each dimension of `a`,
    containing the indices of the non-zero elements in that
    dimension. The values in `a` are always tested and returned in
    row-major, C-style order. The corresponding non-zero
    values can be obtained with::

        a[nonzero(a)]

    To group the indices by element, rather than dimension, use::

        transpose(nonzero(a))

    The result of this is always a 2-D array, with a row for
    each non-zero element.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple_of_arrays : tuple
        Indices of elements that are non-zero.

    See Also
    --------
    flatnonzero :
        Return indices that are non-zero in the flattened version of the input
        array.
    ndarray.nonzero :
        Equivalent ndarray method.
    count_nonzero :
        Counts the number of non-zero elements in the input array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[3, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0], [5, 6, 0]])
    >>> x
    array([[3, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [5, 6, 0]])
    >>> np.nonzero(x)
    (array([0, 1, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 0, 1]))

    >>> x[np.nonzero(x)]
    array([3, 4, 5, 6])
    >>> np.transpose(np.nonzero(x))
    array([[0, 0],
           [1, 1],
           [2, 0],
           [2, 1])

    A common use for ``nonzero`` is to find the indices of an array, where
    a condition is True.  Given an array `a`, the condition `a` > 3 is a
    boolean array and since False is interpreted as 0, np.nonzero(a > 3)
    yields the indices of the `a` where the condition is true.

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    >>> a > 3
    array([[False, False, False],
           [ True,  True,  True],
           [ True,  True,  True]])
    >>> np.nonzero(a > 3)
    (array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]))

    Using this result to index `a` is equivalent to using the mask directly:

    >>> a[np.nonzero(a > 3)]
    array([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
    >>> a[a > 3]  # prefer this spelling
    array([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

    ``nonzero`` can also be called as a method of the array.

    >>> (a > 3).nonzero()
    (array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]))

    
    Check if all elements of input array are true.

    Replaces specified elements of an array with given values.

    The indexing works on the flattened target array. `put` is roughly
    equivalent to:

    ::

        a.flat[ind] = v

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Target array.
    ind : array_like
        Target indices, interpreted as integers.
    v : array_like
        Values to place in `a` at target indices. If `v` is shorter than
        `ind` it will be repeated as necessary.
    mode : {'raise', 'wrap', 'clip'}, optional
        Specifies how out-of-bounds indices will behave.

        * 'raise' -- raise an error (default)
        * 'wrap' -- wrap around
        * 'clip' -- clip to the range

        'clip' mode means that all indices that are too large are replaced
        by the index that addresses the last element along that axis. Note
        that this disables indexing with negative numbers.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(5)
    >>> np.put(a, [0, 2], [-44, -55])
    >>> a
    array([-44,   1, -55,   3,   4])

    >>> a = np.arange(5)
    >>> np.put(a, 22, -5, mode='clip')
    >>> a
    array([ 0,  1,  2,  3, -5])

    _var_dispatcher_shape_dispatcher`rank` is deprecated; use the `ndim` attribute or function instead. To find the rank of a matrix see `numpy.linalg.matrix_rank`._cumprod_dispatcher_swapaxes_dispatcher_sum_dispatcher_searchsorted_dispatcher
    Return a partitioned copy of an array.

    Creates a copy of the array with its elements rearranged in such a
    way that the value of the element in k-th position is in the
    position it would be in a sorted array. All elements smaller than
    the k-th element are moved before this element and all equal or
    greater are moved behind it. The ordering of the elements in the two
    partitions is undefined.

    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array to be sorted.
    kth : int or sequence of ints
        Element index to partition by. The k-th value of the element
        will be in its final sorted position and all smaller elements
        will be moved before it and all equal or greater elements behind
        it. The order of all elements in the partitions is undefined. If
        provided with a sequence of k-th it will partition all elements
        indexed by k-th  of them into their sorted position at once.
    axis : int or None, optional
        Axis along which to sort. If None, the array is flattened before
        sorting. The default is -1, which sorts along the last axis.
    kind : {'introselect'}, optional
        Selection algorithm. Default is 'introselect'.
    order : str or list of str, optional
        When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument
        specifies which fields to compare first, second, etc.  A single
        field can be specified as a string.  Not all fields need be
        specified, but unspecified fields will still be used, in the
        order in which they come up in the dtype, to break ties.

    Returns
    -------
    partitioned_array : ndarray
        Array of the same type and shape as `a`.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.partition : Method to sort an array in-place.
    argpartition : Indirect partition.
    sort : Full sorting

    Notes
    -----
    The various selection algorithms are characterized by their average
    speed, worst case performance, work space size, and whether they are
    stable. A stable sort keeps items with the same key in the same
    relative order. The available algorithms have the following
    properties:

    ================= ======= ============= ============ =======
       kind            speed   worst case    work space  stable
    ================= ======= ============= ============ =======
    'introselect'        1        O(n)           0         no
    ================= ======= ============= ============ =======

    All the partition algorithms make temporary copies of the data when
    partitioning along any but the last axis.  Consequently,
    partitioning along the last axis is faster and uses less space than
    partitioning along any other axis.

    The sort order for complex numbers is lexicographic. If both the
    real and imaginary parts are non-nan then the order is determined by
    the real parts except when they are equal, in which case the order
    is determined by the imaginary parts.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([3, 4, 2, 1])
    >>> np.partition(a, 3)
    array([2, 1, 3, 4])

    >>> np.partition(a, (1, 3))
    array([1, 2, 3, 4])

    
    Compute the standard deviation along the specified axis.

    Returns the standard deviation, a measure of the spread of a distribution,
    of the array elements. The standard deviation is computed for the
    flattened array by default, otherwise over the specified axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Calculate the standard deviation of these values.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which the standard deviation is computed. The
        default is to compute the standard deviation of the flattened array.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If this is a tuple of ints, a standard deviation is performed over
        multiple axes, instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type to use in computing the standard deviation. For arrays of
        integer type the default is float64, for arrays of float types it is
        the same as the array type.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape as the expected output but the type (of the calculated
        values) will be cast if necessary.
    ddof : int, optional
        Means Delta Degrees of Freedom.  The divisor used in calculations
        is ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of elements.
        By default `ddof` is zero.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `std` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    standard_deviation : ndarray, see dtype parameter above.
        If `out` is None, return a new array containing the standard deviation,
        otherwise return a reference to the output array.

    See Also
    --------
    var, mean, nanmean, nanstd, nanvar
    numpy.doc.ufuncs : Section "Output arguments"

    Notes
    -----
    The standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squared
    deviations from the mean, i.e., ``std = sqrt(mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2))``.

    The average squared deviation is normally calculated as
    ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.  If, however, `ddof` is specified,
    the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used instead. In standard statistical
    practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an unbiased estimator of the variance
    of the infinite population. ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood
    estimate of the variance for normally distributed variables. The
    standard deviation computed in this function is the square root of
    the estimated variance, so even with ``ddof=1``, it will not be an
    unbiased estimate of the standard deviation per se.

    Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute
    value before squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the *std* is computed using the same
    precision the input has. Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for float32 (see example below).
    Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the `dtype` keyword can
    alleviate this issue.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.std(a)
    1.1180339887498949
    >>> np.std(a, axis=0)
    array([ 1.,  1.])
    >>> np.std(a, axis=1)
    array([ 0.5,  0.5])

    In single precision, std() can be inaccurate:

    >>> a = np.zeros((2, 512*512), dtype=np.float32)
    >>> a[0, :] = 1.0
    >>> a[1, :] = 0.1
    >>> np.std(a)
    0.45000005

    Computing the standard deviation in float64 is more accurate:

    >>> np.std(a, dtype=np.float64)
    0.44999999925494177

    
    Return the product of array elements over a given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which a product is performed.  The default,
        axis=None, will calculate the product of all the elements in the
        input array. If axis is negative it counts from the last to the
        first axis.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If axis is a tuple of ints, a product is performed on all of the
        axes specified in the tuple instead of a single axis or all the
        axes as before.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        The type of the returned array, as well as of the accumulator in
        which the elements are multiplied.  The dtype of `a` is used by
        default unless `a` has an integer dtype of less precision than the
        default platform integer.  In that case, if `a` is signed then the
        platform integer is used while if `a` is unsigned then an unsigned
        integer of the same precision as the platform integer is used.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape as the expected output, but the type of the output
        values will be cast if necessary.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the
        result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result
        will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `prod` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.
    initial : scalar, optional
        The starting value for this product. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

    Returns
    -------
    product_along_axis : ndarray, see `dtype` parameter above.
        An array shaped as `a` but with the specified axis removed.
        Returns a reference to `out` if specified.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.prod : equivalent method
    numpy.doc.ufuncs : Section "Output arguments"

    Notes
    -----
    Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is
    raised on overflow.  That means that, on a 32-bit platform:

    >>> x = np.array([536870910, 536870910, 536870910, 536870910])
    >>> np.prod(x)  # random
    16

    The product of an empty array is the neutral element 1:

    >>> np.prod([])
    1.0

    Examples
    --------
    By default, calculate the product of all elements:

    >>> np.prod([1.,2.])
    2.0

    Even when the input array is two-dimensional:

    >>> np.prod([[1.,2.],[3.,4.]])
    24.0

    But we can also specify the axis over which to multiply:

    >>> np.prod([[1.,2.],[3.,4.]], axis=1)
    array([  2.,  12.])

    If the type of `x` is unsigned, then the output type is
    the unsigned platform integer:

    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> np.prod(x).dtype == np.uint
    True

    If `x` is of a signed integer type, then the output type
    is the default platform integer:

    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.int8)
    >>> np.prod(x).dtype == int
    True

    You can also start the product with a value other than one:

    >>> np.prod([1, 2], initial=5)
    10
    
    Return the number of dimensions of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.  If it is not already an ndarray, a conversion is
        attempted.

    Returns
    -------
    number_of_dimensions : int
        The number of dimensions in `a`.  Scalars are zero-dimensional.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.ndim : equivalent method
    shape : dimensions of array
    ndarray.shape : dimensions of array

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.ndim([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
    2
    >>> np.ndim(np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]))
    2
    >>> np.ndim(1)
    0

    <module numpy.core.fromnumeric>
    Return the number of elements along a given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the elements are counted.  By default, give
        the total number of elements.

    Returns
    -------
    element_count : int
        Number of elements along the specified axis.

    See Also
    --------
    shape : dimensions of array
    ndarray.shape : dimensions of array
    ndarray.size : number of elements in array

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
    >>> np.size(a)
    6
    >>> np.size(a,1)
    3
    >>> np.size(a,0)
    2

    
    Clip (limit) the values in an array.

    Given an interval, values outside the interval are clipped to
    the interval edges.  For example, if an interval of ``[0, 1]``
    is specified, values smaller than 0 become 0, and values larger
    than 1 become 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing elements to clip.
    a_min : scalar or array_like or `None`
        Minimum value. If `None`, clipping is not performed on lower
        interval edge. Not more than one of `a_min` and `a_max` may be
        `None`.
    a_max : scalar or array_like or `None`
        Maximum value. If `None`, clipping is not performed on upper
        interval edge. Not more than one of `a_min` and `a_max` may be
        `None`. If `a_min` or `a_max` are array_like, then the three
        arrays will be broadcasted to match their shapes.
    out : ndarray, optional
        The results will be placed in this array. It may be the input
        array for in-place clipping.  `out` must be of the right shape
        to hold the output.  Its type is preserved.

    Returns
    -------
    clipped_array : ndarray
        An array with the elements of `a`, but where values
        < `a_min` are replaced with `a_min`, and those > `a_max`
        with `a_max`.

    Examples

    >>> a = np.arange(10)
    >>> np.clip(a, 1, 8)
    array([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8])
    >>> a
    array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
    >>> np.clip(a, 3, 6, out=a)
    array([3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6])
    >>> a = np.arange(10)
    >>> a
    array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
    >>> np.clip(a, [3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], 8)
    array([3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8])

    _prod_dispatcher_compress_dispatcher_std_dispatcher
    Return the maximum of an array or maximum along an axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which to operate.  By default, flattened input is
        used.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If this is a tuple of ints, the maximum is selected over multiple axes,
        instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result.  Must
        be of the same shape and buffer length as the expected output.
        See `doc.ufuncs` (Section "Output arguments") for more details.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `amax` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.

    initial : scalar, optional
        The minimum value of an output element. Must be present to allow
        computation on empty slice. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.15.0


    Returns
    -------
    amax : ndarray or scalar
        Maximum of `a`. If `axis` is None, the result is a scalar value.
        If `axis` is given, the result is an array of dimension
        ``a.ndim - 1``.

    See Also
    --------
    amin :
        The minimum value of an array along a given axis, propagating any NaNs.
    nanmax :
        The maximum value of an array along a given axis, ignoring any NaNs.
    maximum :
        Element-wise maximum of two arrays, propagating any NaNs.
    fmax :
        Element-wise maximum of two arrays, ignoring any NaNs.
    argmax :
        Return the indices of the maximum values.

    nanmin, minimum, fmin

    Notes
    -----
    NaN values are propagated, that is if at least one item is NaN, the
    corresponding max value will be NaN as well. To ignore NaN values
    (MATLAB behavior), please use nanmax.

    Don't use `amax` for element-wise comparison of 2 arrays; when
    ``a.shape[0]`` is 2, ``maximum(a[0], a[1])`` is faster than
    ``amax(a, axis=0)``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(4).reshape((2,2))
    >>> a
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3]])
    >>> np.amax(a)           # Maximum of the flattened array
    3
    >>> np.amax(a, axis=0)   # Maxima along the first axis
    array([2, 3])
    >>> np.amax(a, axis=1)   # Maxima along the second axis
    array([1, 3])

    >>> b = np.arange(5, dtype=float)
    >>> b[2] = np.NaN
    >>> np.amax(b)
    nan
    >>> np.nanmax(b)
    4.0

    You can use an initial value to compute the maximum of an empty slice, or
    to initialize it to a different value:

    >>> np.max([[-50], [10]], axis=-1, initial=0)
    array([ 0, 10])

    Notice that the initial value is used as one of the elements for which the
    maximum is determined, unlike for the default argument Python's max
    function, which is only used for empty iterables.

    >>> np.max([5], initial=6)
    6
    >>> max([5], default=6)
    5
    _nonzero_dispatcher
    Permute the dimensions of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axes : list of ints, optional
        By default, reverse the dimensions, otherwise permute the axes
        according to the values given.

    Returns
    -------
    p : ndarray
        `a` with its axes permuted.  A view is returned whenever
        possible.

    --------
    moveaxis
    argsort

    Notes
    -----
    Use `transpose(a, argsort(axes))` to invert the transposition of tensors
    when using the `axes` keyword argument.

    Transposing a 1-D array returns an unchanged view of the original array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(4).reshape((2,2))
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3]])

    >>> np.transpose(x)
    array([[0, 2],
           [1, 3]])

    >>> x = np.ones((1, 2, 3))
    >>> np.transpose(x, (1, 0, 2)).shape
    (2, 1, 3)

    _trace_dispatcher
    Return a sorted copy of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array to be sorted.
    axis : int or None, optional
        Axis along which to sort. If None, the array is flattened before
        sorting. The default is -1, which sorts along the last axis.
    kind : {'quicksort', 'mergesort', 'heapsort', 'stable'}, optional
        Sorting algorithm. Default is 'quicksort'.
    order : str or list of str, optional
        When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument specifies
        which fields to compare first, second, etc.  A single field can
        be specified as a string, and not all fields need be specified,
        but unspecified fields will still be used, in the order in which
        they come up in the dtype, to break ties.

    Returns
    -------
    sorted_array : ndarray
        Array of the same type and shape as `a`.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.sort : Method to sort an array in-place.
    argsort : Indirect sort.
    lexsort : Indirect stable sort on multiple keys.
    searchsorted : Find elements in a sorted array.
    partition : Partial sort.

    Notes
    -----
    The various sorting algorithms are characterized by their average speed,
    worst case performance, work space size, and whether they are stable. A
    stable sort keeps items with the same key in the same relative
    order. The three available algorithms have the following
    properties:

    =========== ======= ============= ============ ========

    All the sort algorithms make temporary copies of the data when
    sorting along any but the last axis.  Consequently, sorting along
    the last axis is faster and uses less space than sorting along
    any other axis.

    The sort order for complex numbers is lexicographic. If both the real
    and imaginary parts are non-nan then the order is determined by the
    real parts except when they are equal, in which case the order is
    determined by the imaginary parts.

    Previous to numpy 1.4.0 sorting real and complex arrays containing nan
    values led to undefined behaviour. In numpy versions >= 1.4.0 nan
    values are sorted to the end. The extended sort order is:

      * Real: [R, nan]
      * Complex: [R + Rj, R + nanj, nan + Rj, nan + nanj]

    where R is a non-nan real value. Complex values with the same nan
    placements are sorted according to the non-nan part if it exists.
    Non-nan values are sorted as before.

    .. versionadded:: 1.12.0

    quicksort has been changed to an introsort which will switch
    heapsort when it does not make enough progress. This makes its
    worst case O(n*log(n)).

    'stable' automatically choses the best stable sorting algorithm
    for the data type being sorted. It is currently mapped to
    merge sort.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1,4],[3,1]])
    >>> np.sort(a)                # sort along the last axis
    array([[1, 4],
           [1, 3]])
    >>> np.sort(a, axis=None)     # sort the flattened array
    array([1, 1, 3, 4])
    >>> np.sort(a, axis=0)        # sort along the first axis
    array([[1, 1],
           [3, 4]])

    Use the `order` keyword to specify a field to use when sorting a
    structured array:

    >>> dtype = [('name', 'S10'), ('height', float), ('age', int)]
    >>> values = [('Arthur', 1.8, 41), ('Lancelot', 1.9, 38),
    ...           ('Galahad', 1.7, 38)]
    >>> a = np.array(values, dtype=dtype)       # create a structured array
    >>> np.sort(a, order='height')                        # doctest: +SKIP
    array([('Galahad', 1.7, 38), ('Arthur', 1.8, 41),
           ('Lancelot', 1.8999999999999999, 38)],
          dtype=[('name', '|S10'), ('height', '<f8'), ('age', '<i4')])

    Sort by age, then height if ages are equal:

    >>> np.sort(a, order=['age', 'height'])               # doctest: +SKIP
    array([('Galahad', 1.7, 38), ('Lancelot', 1.8999999999999999, 38),
           ('Arthur', 1.8, 41)],
          dtype=[('name', '|S10'), ('height', '<f8'), ('age', '<i4')])

    
    Returns the indices of the minimum values along an axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        By default, the index is into the flattened array, otherwise
        along the specified axis.
    out : array, optional
        If provided, the result will be inserted into this array. It should
        be of the appropriate shape and dtype.

    Returns
    -------
    index_array : ndarray of ints
        Array of indices into the array. It has the same shape as `a.shape`
        with the dimension along `axis` removed.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.argmin, argmax
    amin : The minimum value along a given axis.
    unravel_index : Convert a flat index into an index tuple.

    Notes
    -----
    In case of multiple occurrences of the minimum values, the indices
    corresponding to the first occurrence are returned.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(6).reshape(2,3) + 10
    >>> a
    array([[10, 11, 12],
           [13, 14, 15]])
    >>> np.argmin(a)
    0
    >>> np.argmin(a, axis=0)
    array([0, 0, 0])
    >>> np.argmin(a, axis=1)
    array([0, 0])

    Indices of the minimum elements of a N-dimensional array:

    >>> ind = np.unravel_index(np.argmin(a, axis=None), a.shape)
    >>> ind
    (0, 0)
    >>> a[ind]
    10

    >>> b = np.arange(6) + 10
    >>> b[4] = 10
    >>> b
    array([10, 11, 12, 13, 10, 15])
    >>> np.argmin(b)  # Only the first occurrence is returned.
    0

    _argmin_dispatcherReturn a contiguous flattened array.

    A 1-D array, containing the elements of the input, is returned.  A copy is
    made only if needed.

    As of NumPy 1.10, the returned array will have the same type as the input
    array. (for example, a masked array will be returned for a masked array
    input)

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.  The elements in `a` are read in the order specified by
        `order`, and packed as a 1-D array.
    order : {'C','F', 'A', 'K'}, optional

        The elements of `a` are read using this index order. 'C' means
        to index the elements in row-major, C-style order,
        with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the first
        axis index changing slowest.  'F' means to index the elements
        in column-major, Fortran-style order, with the
        first index changing fastest, and the last index changing
        slowest. Note that the 'C' and 'F' options take no account of
        the memory layout of the underlying array, and only refer to
        the order of axis indexing.  'A' means to read the elements in
        Fortran-like index order if `a` is Fortran *contiguous* in
        memory, C-like order otherwise.  'K' means to read the
        elements in the order they occur in memory, except for
        reversing the data when strides are negative.  By default, 'C'
        index order is used.

    Returns
    -------
    y : array_like
        y is an array of the same subtype as `a`, with shape ``(a.size,)``.
        Note that matrices are special cased for backward compatibility, if `a`
        is a matrix, then y is a 1-D ndarray.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.flat : 1-D iterator over an array.
    ndarray.flatten : 1-D array copy of the elements of an array
                      in row-major order.
    ndarray.reshape : Change the shape of an array without changing its data.

    Notes
    -----
    In row-major, C-style order, in two dimensions, the row index
    varies the slowest, and the column index the quickest.  This can
    be generalized to multiple dimensions, where row-major order
    implies that the index along the first axis varies slowest, and
    the index along the last quickest.  The opposite holds for
    column-major, Fortran-style index ordering.

    When a view is desired in as many cases as possible, ``arr.reshape(-1)``
    may be preferable.

    Examples
    --------
    It is equivalent to ``reshape(-1, order=order)``.

    >>> x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> print(np.ravel(x))
    [1 2 3 4 5 6]

    >>> print(x.reshape(-1))
    [1 2 3 4 5 6]

    >>> print(np.ravel(x, order='F'))
    [1 4 2 5 3 6]

    When ``order`` is 'A', it will preserve the array's 'C' or 'F' ordering:

    >>> print(np.ravel(x.T))
    [1 4 2 5 3 6]
    >>> print(np.ravel(x.T, order='A'))
    [1 2 3 4 5 6]

    When ``order`` is 'K', it will preserve orderings that are neither 'C'
    nor 'F', but won't reverse axes:

    >>> a = np.arange(3)[::-1]; a
    array([2, 1, 0])
    >>> a.ravel(order='C')
    array([2, 1, 0])
    >>> a.ravel(order='K')
    array([2, 1, 0])

    >>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(2,3,2).swapaxes(1,2); a
    array([[[ 0,  2,  4],
            [ 1,  3,  5]],
           [[ 6,  8, 10],
            [ 7,  9, 11]]])
    >>> a.ravel(order='C')
    array([ 0,  2,  4,  1,  3,  5,  6,  8, 10,  7,  9, 11])
    >>> a.ravel(order='K')
    array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11])

    
    Perform an indirect partition along the given axis using the
    algorithm specified by the `kind` keyword. It returns an array of
    indices of the same shape as `a` that index data along the given
    axis in partitioned order.

    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array to sort.
    kth : int or sequence of ints
        Element index to partition by. The k-th element will be in its
        final sorted position and all smaller elements will be moved
        before it and all larger elements behind it. The order all
        elements in the partitions is undefined. If provided with a
        sequence of k-th it will partition all of them into their sorted
        position at once.
    axis : int or None, optional
        Axis along which to sort. The default is -1 (the last axis). If
        None, the flattened array is used.
    kind : {'introselect'}, optional
        Selection algorithm. Default is 'introselect'
    order : str or list of str, optional
        When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument
        specifies which fields to compare first, second, etc. A single
        field can be specified as a string, and not all fields need be
        specified, but unspecified fields will still be used, in the
        order in which they come up in the dtype, to break ties.

    Returns
    -------
    index_array : ndarray, int
        Array of indices that partition `a` along the specified axis.
        If `a` is one-dimensional, ``a[index_array]`` yields a partitioned `a`.
        More generally, ``np.take_along_axis(a, index_array, axis=a)`` always
        yields the partitioned `a`, irrespective of dimensionality.

    See Also
    --------
    partition : Describes partition algorithms used.
    ndarray.partition : Inplace partition.
    argsort : Full indirect sort

    Notes
    -----
    See `partition` for notes on the different selection algorithms.

    Examples
    --------
    One dimensional array:

    >>> x = np.array([3, 4, 2, 1])
    >>> x[np.argpartition(x, 3)]
    array([2, 1, 3, 4])
    >>> x[np.argpartition(x, (1, 3))]
    array([1, 2, 3, 4])

    >>> x = [3, 4, 2, 1]
    >>> np.array(x)[np.argpartition(x, 3)]
    array([2, 1, 3, 4])

    _argpartition_dispatcher
    Returns the indices that would sort an array.

    Perform an indirect sort along the given axis using the algorithm specified
    by the `kind` keyword. It returns an array of indices of the same shape as
    `a` that index data along the given axis in sorted order.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array to sort.
    axis : int or None, optional
        Axis along which to sort.  The default is -1 (the last axis). If None,
        the flattened array is used.
    kind : {'quicksort', 'mergesort', 'heapsort', 'stable'}, optional
        Sorting algorithm.
    order : str or list of str, optional
        When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument specifies
        which fields to compare first, second, etc.  A single field can
        be specified as a string, and not all fields need be specified,
        but unspecified fields will still be used, in the order in which
        they come up in the dtype, to break ties.

    Returns
    -------
    index_array : ndarray, int
        Array of indices that sort `a` along the specified axis.
        If `a` is one-dimensional, ``a[index_array]`` yields a sorted `a`.
        More generally, ``np.take_along_axis(a, index_array, axis=a)`` always
        yields the sorted `a`, irrespective of dimensionality.

    --------
    sort : Describes sorting algorithms used.
    lexsort : Indirect stable sort with multiple keys.
    ndarray.sort : Inplace sort.
    argpartition : Indirect partial sort.

    Notes
    -----
    See `sort` for notes on the different sorting algorithms.

    As of NumPy 1.4.0 `argsort` works with real/complex arrays containing
    nan values. The enhanced sort order is documented in `sort`.

    Examples
    --------
    One dimensional array:

    >>> x = np.array([3, 1, 2])
    >>> np.argsort(x)
    array([1, 2, 0])

    Two-dimensional array:

    >>> x = np.array([[0, 3], [2, 2]])
    >>> x
    array([[0, 3],
           [2, 2]])

    >>> np.argsort(x, axis=0)  # sorts along first axis (down)
    array([[0, 1],
           [1, 0]])

    >>> np.argsort(x, axis=1)  # sorts along last axis (across)
    array([[0, 1],
           [0, 1]])

    Indices of the sorted elements of a N-dimensional array:

    >>> ind = np.unravel_index(np.argsort(x, axis=None), x.shape)
    >>> ind
    (array([0, 1, 1, 0]), array([0, 0, 1, 1]))
    >>> x[ind]  # same as np.sort(x, axis=None)
    array([0, 2, 2, 3])

    Sorting with keys:

    >>> x = np.array([(1, 0), (0, 1)], dtype=[('x', '<i4'), ('y', '<i4')])
    >>> x
    array([(1, 0), (0, 1)],
          dtype=[('x', '<i4'), ('y', '<i4')])

    >>> np.argsort(x, order=('x','y'))
    array([1, 0])

    >>> np.argsort(x, order=('y','x'))
    array([0, 1])

    
    Check whether some values are true.

    Refer to `any` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    any : equivalent function; see for details.
    _mean_dispatcher_resize_dispatcher_wrapfunc
    Return specified diagonals.

    If `a` is 2-D, returns the diagonal of `a` with the given offset,
    i.e., the collection of elements of the form ``a[i, i+offset]``.  If
    `a` has more than two dimensions, then the axes specified by `axis1`
    and `axis2` are used to determine the 2-D sub-array whose diagonal is
    returned.  The shape of the resulting array can be determined by
    removing `axis1` and `axis2` and appending an index to the right equal
    to the size of the resulting diagonals.

    In versions of NumPy prior to 1.7, this function always returned a new,
    independent array containing a copy of the values in the diagonal.

    In NumPy 1.7 and 1.8, it continues to return a copy of the diagonal,
    but depending on this fact is deprecated. Writing to the resulting
    array continues to work as it used to, but a FutureWarning is issued.

    Starting in NumPy 1.9 it returns a read-only view on the original array.
    Attempting to write to the resulting array will produce an error.

    In some future release, it will return a read/write view and writing to
    the returned array will alter your original array.  The returned array
    will have the same type as the input array.

    If you don't write to the array returned by this function, then you can
    just ignore all of the above.

    If you depend on the current behavior, then we suggest copying the
    returned array explicitly, i.e., use ``np.diagonal(a).copy()`` instead
    of just ``np.diagonal(a)``. This will work with both past and future
    versions of NumPy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array from which the diagonals are taken.
    offset : int, optional
        Offset of the diagonal from the main diagonal.  Can be positive or
        negative.  Defaults to main diagonal (0).
    axis1 : int, optional
        Axis to be used as the first axis of the 2-D sub-arrays from which
        the diagonals should be taken.  Defaults to first axis (0).
    axis2 : int, optional
        Axis to be used as the second axis of the 2-D sub-arrays from
        which the diagonals should be taken. Defaults to second axis (1).

    Returns
    -------
    array_of_diagonals : ndarray
        If `a` is 2-D, then a 1-D array containing the diagonal and of the
        same type as `a` is returned unless `a` is a `matrix`, in which case
        a 1-D array rather than a (2-D) `matrix` is returned in order to
        maintain backward compatibility.
        
        If ``a.ndim > 2``, then the dimensions specified by `axis1` and `axis2`
        are removed, and a new axis inserted at the end corresponding to the
        diagonal.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the dimension of `a` is less than 2.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(4).reshape(2,2)
    >>> a
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3]])
    >>> a.diagonal()
    array([0, 3])
    >>> a.diagonal(1)
    array([1])

    A 3-D example:

    >>> a = np.arange(8).reshape(2,2,2); a
    array([[[0, 1],
            [2, 3]],
           [[4, 5],
            [6, 7]]])
    >>> a.diagonal(0, # Main diagonals of two arrays created by skipping
    ...            0, # across the outer(left)-most axis last and
    ...            1) # the "middle" (row) axis first.
    array([[0, 6],
           [1, 7]])

    The sub-arrays whose main diagonals we just obtained; note that each
    corresponds to fixing the right-most (column) axis, and that the
    diagonals are "packed" in rows.

    >>> a[:,:,0] # main diagonal is [0 6]
    array([[0, 2],
           [4, 6]])
    >>> a[:,:,1] # main diagonal is [1 7]
    array([[1, 3],
           [5, 7]])

    
    Return the number of dimensions of an array.

    .. note::
        This function is deprecated in NumPy 1.9 to avoid confusion with
        `numpy.linalg.matrix_rank`. The ``ndim`` attribute or function
        should be used instead.

    See Also
    --------
    ndim : equivalent non-deprecated function

    Notes
    -----
    In the old Numeric package, `rank` was the term used for the number of
    dimensions, but in NumPy `ndim` is used instead.
    
    Return the sum along diagonals of the array.

    If `a` is 2-D, the sum along its diagonal with the given offset
    is returned, i.e., the sum of elements ``a[i,i+offset]`` for all i.

    If `a` has more than two dimensions, then the axes specified by axis1 and
    axis2 are used to determine the 2-D sub-arrays whose traces are returned.
    The shape of the resulting array is the same as that of `a` with `axis1`
    and `axis2` removed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array, from which the diagonals are taken.
    offset : int, optional
        Offset of the diagonal from the main diagonal. Can be both positive
        and negative. Defaults to 0.
    axis1, axis2 : int, optional
        Axes to be used as the first and second axis of the 2-D sub-arrays
        from which the diagonals should be taken. Defaults are the first two
        axes of `a`.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Determines the data-type of the returned array and of the accumulator
        where the elements are summed. If dtype has the value None and `a` is
        of integer type of precision less than the default integer
        precision, then the default integer precision is used. Otherwise,
        the precision is the same as that of `a`.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Array into which the output is placed. Its type is preserved and
        it must be of the right shape to hold the output.

    Returns
    -------
    sum_along_diagonals : ndarray
        If `a` is 2-D, the sum along the diagonal is returned.  If `a` has
        larger dimensions, then an array of sums along diagonals is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    diag, diagonal, diagflat

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.trace(np.eye(3))
    3.0
    >>> a = np.arange(8).reshape((2,2,2))
    >>> np.trace(a)
    array([6, 8])

    >>> a = np.arange(24).reshape((2,2,2,3))
    >>> np.trace(a).shape
    (2, 3)

    
    Return a new array with the specified shape.

    If the new array is larger than the original array, then the new
    array is filled with repeated copies of `a`.  Note that this behavior
    is different from a.resize(new_shape) which fills with zeros instead
    of repeated copies of `a`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array to be resized.

    new_shape : int or tuple of int
        Shape of resized array.

    Returns
    -------
    reshaped_array : ndarray
        The new array is formed from the data in the old array, repeated
        if necessary to fill out the required number of elements.  The
        data are repeated in the order that they are stored in memory.

    Warning: This functionality does **not** consider axes separately,
    i.e. it does not apply interpolation/extrapolation.
    It fills the return array with the required number of elements, taken
    from `a` as they are laid out in memory, disregarding strides and axes.
    (This is in case the new shape is smaller. For larger, see above.)
    This functionality is therefore not suitable to resize images,
    or data where each axis represents a separate and distinct entity.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a=np.array([[0,1],[2,3]])
    >>> np.resize(a,(2,3))
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 0, 1]])
    >>> np.resize(a,(1,4))
    array([[0, 1, 2, 3]])
    >>> np.resize(a,(2,4))
    array([[0, 1, 2, 3],
           [0, 1, 2, 3]])

    around : equivalent function; see for details.
    _clip_dispatcher_wrapreduction
    Return selected slices of an array along given axis.

    When working along a given axis, a slice along that axis is returned in
    `output` for each index where `condition` evaluates to True. When
    working on a 1-D array, `compress` is equivalent to `extract`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    condition : 1-D array of bools
        Array that selects which entries to return. If len(condition)
        is less than the size of `a` along the given axis, then output is
        truncated to the length of the condition array.
    a : array_like
        Array from which to extract a part.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to take slices. If None (default), work on the
        flattened array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Output array.  Its type is preserved and it must be of the right
        shape to hold the output.

    Returns
    -------
    compressed_array : ndarray
        A copy of `a` without the slices along axis for which `condition`
        is false.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
    >>> a
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4],
           [5, 6]])
    >>> np.compress([0, 1], a, axis=0)
    array([[3, 4]])
    >>> np.compress([False, True, True], a, axis=0)
    array([[3, 4],
           [5, 6]])
    >>> np.compress([False, True], a, axis=1)
    array([[2],
           [4],
           [6]])

    Working on the flattened array does not return slices along an axis but
    selects elements.

    >>> np.compress([False, True], a)
    array([2])

    
    Construct an array from an index array and a set of arrays to choose from.

    First of all, if confused or uncertain, definitely look at the Examples -
    in its full generality, this function is less simple than it might
    seem from the following code description (below ndi =
    `numpy.lib.index_tricks`):

    ``np.choose(a,c) == np.array([c[a[I]][I] for I in ndi.ndindex(a.shape)])``.

    But this omits some subtleties.  Here is a fully general summary:

    Given an "index" array (`a`) of integers and a sequence of `n` arrays
    (`choices`), `a` and each choice array are first broadcast, as necessary,
    to arrays of a common shape; calling these *Ba* and *Bchoices[i], i =
    0,...,n-1* we have that, necessarily, ``Ba.shape == Bchoices[i].shape``
    for each `i`.  Then, a new array with shape ``Ba.shape`` is created as
    follows:

    * if ``mode=raise`` (the default), then, first of all, each element of
      `a` (and thus `Ba`) must be in the range `[0, n-1]`; now, suppose that
      `i` (in that range) is the value at the `(j0, j1, ..., jm)` position
      in `Ba` - then the value at the same position in the new array is the
      value in `Bchoices[i]` at that same position;

    * if ``mode=wrap``, values in `a` (and thus `Ba`) may be any (signed)
      integer; modular arithmetic is used to map integers outside the range
      `[0, n-1]` back into that range; and then the new array is constructed
      as above;

    * if ``mode=clip``, values in `a` (and thus `Ba`) may be any (signed)
      integer; negative integers are mapped to 0; values greater than `n-1`
      are mapped to `n-1`; and then the new array is constructed as above.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : int array
        This array must contain integers in `[0, n-1]`, where `n` is the number
        of choices, unless ``mode=wrap`` or ``mode=clip``, in which cases any
        integers are permissible.
    choices : sequence of arrays
        Choice arrays. `a` and all of the choices must be broadcastable to the
        same shape.  If `choices` is itself an array (not recommended), then
        its outermost dimension (i.e., the one corresponding to
        ``choices.shape[0]``) is taken as defining the "sequence".
    out : array, optional
        If provided, the result will be inserted into this array. It should
        be of the appropriate shape and dtype.
    mode : {'raise' (default), 'wrap', 'clip'}, optional
        Specifies how indices outside `[0, n-1]` will be treated:

          * 'raise' : an exception is raised
          * 'wrap' : value becomes value mod `n`
          * 'clip' : values < 0 are mapped to 0, values > n-1 are mapped to n-1

    Returns
    -------
    merged_array : array
        The merged result.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError: shape mismatch
        If `a` and each choice array are not all broadcastable to the same
        shape.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.choose : equivalent method

    Notes
    -----
    To reduce the chance of misinterpretation, even though the following
    "abuse" is nominally supported, `choices` should neither be, nor be
    thought of as, a single array, i.e., the outermost sequence-like container
    should be either a list or a tuple.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> choices = [[0, 1, 2, 3], [10, 11, 12, 13],
    ...   [20, 21, 22, 23], [30, 31, 32, 33]]
    >>> np.choose([2, 3, 1, 0], choices
    ... # the first element of the result will be the first element of the
    ... # third (2+1) "array" in choices, namely, 20; the second element
    ... # will be the second element of the fourth (3+1) choice array, i.e.,
    ... # 31, etc.
    ... )
    array([20, 31, 12,  3])
    >>> np.choose([2, 4, 1, 0], choices, mode='clip') # 4 goes to 3 (4-1)
    array([20, 31, 12,  3])
    >>> # because there are 4 choice arrays
    >>> np.choose([2, 4, 1, 0], choices, mode='wrap') # 4 goes to (4 mod 4)
    array([20,  1, 12,  3])
    >>> # i.e., 0

    A couple examples illustrating how choose broadcasts:

    >>> a = [[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]
    >>> choices = [-10, 10]
    >>> np.choose(a, choices)
    array([[ 10, -10,  10],
           [-10,  10, -10],
           [ 10, -10,  10]])

    >>> # With thanks to Anne Archibald
    >>> a = np.array([0, 1]).reshape((2,1,1))
    >>> c1 = np.array([1, 2, 3]).reshape((1,3,1))
    >>> c2 = np.array([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]).reshape((1,1,5))
    >>> np.choose(a, (c1, c2)) # result is 2x3x5, res[0,:,:]=c1, res[1,:,:]=c2
    array([[[ 1,  1,  1,  1,  1],
            [ 2,  2,  2,  2,  2],
            [ 3,  3,  3,  3,  3]],
           [[-1, -2, -3, -4, -5],
            [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5],
            [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]]])

    _ndim_dispatcher
    Returns the indices of the maximum values along an axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        By default, the index is into the flattened array, otherwise
        along the specified axis.
    out : array, optional
        If provided, the result will be inserted into this array. It should
        be of the appropriate shape and dtype.

    Returns
    -------
    index_array : ndarray of ints
        Array of indices into the array. It has the same shape as `a.shape`
        with the dimension along `axis` removed.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.argmax, argmin
    amax : The maximum value along a given axis.
    unravel_index : Convert a flat index into an index tuple.

    Notes
    -----
    In case of multiple occurrences of the maximum values, the indices
    corresponding to the first occurrence are returned.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(6).reshape(2,3) + 10
    >>> a
    array([[10, 11, 12],
           [13, 14, 15]])
    >>> np.argmax(a)
    5
    >>> np.argmax(a, axis=0)
    array([1, 1, 1])
    >>> np.argmax(a, axis=1)
    array([2, 2])

    Indexes of the maximal elements of a N-dimensional array:

    >>> ind = np.unravel_index(np.argmax(a, axis=None), a.shape)
    >>> ind
    (1, 2)
    >>> a[ind]
    15

    >>> b = np.arange(6)
    >>> b[1] = 5
    >>> b
    array([0, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    >>> np.argmax(b)  # Only the first occurrence is returned.
    1

    
    Test whether all array elements along a given axis evaluate to True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which a logical AND reduction is performed.
        The default (`axis` = `None`) is to perform a logical AND over all
        the dimensions of the input array. `axis` may be negative, in
        which case it counts from the last to the first axis.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If this is a tuple of ints, a reduction is performed on multiple
        axes, instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.
        It must have the same shape as the expected output and its
        type is preserved (e.g., if ``dtype(out)`` is float, the result
        will consist of 0.0's and 1.0's).  See `doc.ufuncs` (Section
        "Output arguments") for more details.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `all` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    all : ndarray, bool
        A new boolean or array is returned unless `out` is specified,
        in which case a reference to `out` is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.all : equivalent method

    any : Test whether any element along a given axis evaluates to True.

    Notes
    -----
    Not a Number (NaN), positive infinity and negative infinity
    evaluate to `True` because these are not equal to zero.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.all([[True,False],[True,True]])
    False

    >>> np.all([[True,False],[True,True]], axis=0)
    array([ True, False])

    >>> np.all([-1, 4, 5])
    True

    >>> np.all([1.0, np.nan])
    True

    >>> o=np.array([False])
    >>> z=np.all([-1, 4, 5], out=o)
    >>> id(z), id(o), z                             # doctest: +SKIP
    (28293632, 28293632, array([ True]))

    _choose_dispatcher_amin_dispatcher_sort_dispatcher_take_dispatcher
    Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array to be reshaped.
    newshape : int or tuple of ints
        The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If
        an integer, then the result will be a 1-D array of that length.
        One shape dimension can be -1. In this case, the value is
        inferred from the length of the array and remaining dimensions.
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A'}, optional
        Read the elements of `a` using this index order, and place the
        elements into the reshaped array using this index order.  'C'
        means to read / write the elements using C-like index order,
        with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the first
        axis index changing slowest. 'F' means to read / write the
        elements using Fortran-like index order, with the first index
        changing fastest, and the last index changing slowest. Note that
        the 'C' and 'F' options take no account of the memory layout of
        the underlying array, and only refer to the order of indexing.
        'A' means to read / write the elements in Fortran-like index
        order if `a` is Fortran *contiguous* in memory, C-like order
        otherwise.

    Returns
    -------
    reshaped_array : ndarray
        This will be a new view object if possible; otherwise, it will
        be a copy.  Note there is no guarantee of the *memory layout* (C- or
        Fortran- contiguous) of the returned array.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.reshape : Equivalent method.

    Notes
    -----
    It is not always possible to change the shape of an array without
    copying the data. If you want an error to be raised when the data is copied,
    you should assign the new shape to the shape attribute of the array::

     >>> a = np.zeros((10, 2))
     # A transpose makes the array non-contiguous
     >>> b = a.T
     # Taking a view makes it possible to modify the shape without modifying
     # the initial object.
     >>> c = b.view()
     >>> c.shape = (20)
     AttributeError: incompatible shape for a non-contiguous array

    The `order` keyword gives the index ordering both for *fetching* the values
    from `a`, and then *placing* the values into the output array.
    For example, let's say you have an array:

    >>> a = np.arange(6).reshape((3, 2))
    >>> a
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3],
           [4, 5]])

    You can think of reshaping as first raveling the array (using the given
    index order), then inserting the elements from the raveled array into the
    new array using the same kind of index ordering as was used for the
    raveling.

    >>> np.reshape(a, (2, 3)) # C-like index ordering
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5]])
    >>> np.reshape(np.ravel(a), (2, 3)) # equivalent to C ravel then C reshape
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5]])
    >>> np.reshape(a, (2, 3), order='F') # Fortran-like index ordering
    array([[0, 4, 3],
           [2, 1, 5]])
    >>> np.reshape(np.ravel(a, order='F'), (2, 3), order='F')
    array([[0, 4, 3],
           [2, 1, 5]])

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
    >>> np.reshape(a, 6)
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    >>> np.reshape(a, 6, order='F')
    array([1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6])

    >>> np.reshape(a, (3,-1))       # the unspecified value is inferred to be 2
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4],
           [5, 6]])

    Return the minimum of an array or minimum along an axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which to operate.  By default, flattened input is
        used.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If this is a tuple of ints, the minimum is selected over multiple axes,
        instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result.  Must
        be of the same shape and buffer length as the expected output.
        See `doc.ufuncs` (Section "Output arguments") for more details.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `amin` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.

    initial : scalar, optional
        The maximum value of an output element. Must be present to allow
        computation on empty slice. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

    Returns
    -------
    amin : ndarray or scalar
        Minimum of `a`. If `axis` is None, the result is a scalar value.
        If `axis` is given, the result is an array of dimension
        ``a.ndim - 1``.

    See Also
    --------
    amax :
        The maximum value of an array along a given axis, propagating any NaNs.
    nanmin :
        The minimum value of an array along a given axis, ignoring any NaNs.
    minimum :
        Element-wise minimum of two arrays, propagating any NaNs.
    fmin :
        Element-wise minimum of two arrays, ignoring any NaNs.
    argmin :
        Return the indices of the minimum values.

    nanmax, maximum, fmax

    Notes
    -----
    NaN values are propagated, that is if at least one item is NaN, the
    corresponding min value will be NaN as well. To ignore NaN values
    (MATLAB behavior), please use nanmin.

    Don't use `amin` for element-wise comparison of 2 arrays; when
    ``a.shape[0]`` is 2, ``minimum(a[0], a[1])`` is faster than
    ``amin(a, axis=0)``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(4).reshape((2,2))
    >>> a
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3]])
    >>> np.amin(a)           # Minimum of the flattened array
    0
    >>> np.amin(a, axis=0)   # Minima along the first axis
    array([0, 1])
    >>> np.amin(a, axis=1)   # Minima along the second axis
    array([0, 2])

    >>> b = np.arange(5, dtype=float)
    >>> b[2] = np.NaN
    >>> np.amin(b)
    nan
    >>> np.nanmin(b)
    0.0

    >>> np.min([[-50], [10]], axis=-1, initial=0)
    array([-50,   0])

    Notice that the initial value is used as one of the elements for which the
    minimum is determined, unlike for the default argument Python's max
    function, which is only used for empty iterables.

    Notice that this isn't the same as Python's ``default`` argument.

    >>> np.min([6], initial=5)
    5
    >>> min([6], default=5)
    6
    
    Compute the variance along the specified axis.

    Returns the variance of the array elements, a measure of the spread of a
    distribution.  The variance is computed for the flattened array by
    default, otherwise over the specified axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose variance is desired.  If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which the variance is computed.  The default is to
        compute the variance of the flattened array.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If this is a tuple of ints, a variance is performed over multiple axes,
        instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Type to use in computing the variance.  For arrays of integer type
        the default is `float32`; for arrays of float types it is the same as
        the array type.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  It must have
        the same shape as the expected output, but the type is cast if
        necessary.
    ddof : int, optional
        "Delta Degrees of Freedom": the divisor used in the calculation is
        ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of elements. By
        default `ddof` is zero.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `var` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    variance : ndarray, see dtype parameter above
        If ``out=None``, returns a new array containing the variance;
        otherwise, a reference to the output array is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    std , mean, nanmean, nanstd, nanvar
    numpy.doc.ufuncs : Section "Output arguments"

    Notes
    -----
    The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean,
    i.e.,  ``var = mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2)``.

    The mean is normally calculated as ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.
    If, however, `ddof` is specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used
    instead.  In standard statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an
    unbiased estimator of the variance of a hypothetical infinite population.
    ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the variance for
    normally distributed variables.

    Note that for complex numbers, the absolute value is taken before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the variance is computed using the same
    precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see example
    below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the ``dtype``
    keyword can alleviate this issue.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.var(a)
    1.25
    >>> np.var(a, axis=0)
    array([ 1.,  1.])
    >>> np.var(a, axis=1)
    array([ 0.25,  0.25])

    In single precision, var() can be inaccurate:

    >>> a = np.zeros((2, 512*512), dtype=np.float32)
    >>> a[0, :] = 1.0
    >>> a[1, :] = 0.1
    >>> np.var(a)
    0.20250003

    Computing the variance in float64 is more accurate:

    >>> np.var(a, dtype=np.float64)
    0.20249999932944759
    >>> ((1-0.55)**2 + (0.1-0.55)**2)/2
    0.2025

    _gentype_put_dispatcher_dt_
    Compute the arithmetic mean along the specified axis.

    Returns the average of the array elements.  The average is taken over
    the flattened array by default, otherwise over the specified axis.
    `float64` intermediate and return values are used for integer inputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose mean is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which the means are computed. The default is to
        compute the mean of the flattened array.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If this is a tuple of ints, a mean is performed over multiple axes,
        instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Type to use in computing the mean.  For integer inputs, the default
        is `float64`; for floating point inputs, it is the same as the
        input dtype.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary.
        See `doc.ufuncs` for details.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `mean` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    m : ndarray, see dtype parameter above
        If `out=None`, returns a new array containing the mean values,
        otherwise a reference to the output array is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    average : Weighted average
    std, var, nanmean, nanstd, nanvar

    Notes
    -----
    The arithmetic mean is the sum of the elements along the axis divided
    by the number of elements.

    Note that for floating-point input, the mean is computed using the
    same precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can
    cause the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see
    example below).  Specifying a higher-precision accumulator using the
    `dtype` keyword can alleviate this issue.

    By default, `float16` results are computed using `float32` intermediates
    for extra precision.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.mean(a)
    2.5
    >>> np.mean(a, axis=0)
    array([ 2.,  3.])
    >>> np.mean(a, axis=1)
    array([ 1.5,  3.5])

    In single precision, `mean` can be inaccurate:

    >>> a = np.zeros((2, 512*512), dtype=np.float32)
    >>> a[0, :] = 1.0
    >>> a[1, :] = 0.1
    >>> np.mean(a)
    0.54999924

    Computing the mean in float64 is more accurate:

    >>> np.mean(a, dtype=np.float64)
    0.55000000074505806

    _around_dispatcher/home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/core/fromnumeric.py_diagonal_dispatcher
    Test whether any array element along a given axis evaluates to True.

    Returns single boolean unless `axis` is not ``None``

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which a logical OR reduction is performed.
        The default (`axis` = `None`) is to perform a logical OR over all
        the dimensions of the input array. `axis` may be negative, in
        which case it counts from the last to the first axis.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If this is a tuple of ints, a reduction is performed on multiple
        axes, instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  It must have
        the same shape as the expected output and its type is preserved
        (e.g., if it is of type float, then it will remain so, returning
        1.0 for True and 0.0 for False, regardless of the type of `a`).
        See `doc.ufuncs` (Section "Output arguments") for details.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `any` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    any : bool or ndarray
        A new boolean or `ndarray` is returned unless `out` is specified,
        in which case a reference to `out` is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.any : equivalent method

    all : Test whether all elements along a given axis evaluate to True.

    Notes
    -----
    Not a Number (NaN), positive infinity and negative infinity evaluate
    to `True` because these are not equal to zero.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.any([[True, False], [True, True]])
    True

    >>> np.any([[True, False], [False, False]], axis=0)
    array([ True, False])

    >>> np.any([-1, 0, 5])
    True

    >>> np.any(np.nan)
    True

    >>> o=np.array([False])
    >>> z=np.any([-1, 4, 5], out=o)
    >>> z, o
    (array([ True]), array([ True]))
    >>> # Check now that z is a reference to o
    >>> z is o
    True
    >>> id(z), id(o) # identity of z and o              # doctest: +SKIP

    _all_dispatcher
    Evenly round to the given number of decimals.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    decimals : int, optional
        Number of decimal places to round to (default: 0).  If
        decimals is negative, it specifies the number of positions to
        the left of the decimal point.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape as the expected output, but the type of the output
        values will be cast if necessary. See `doc.ufuncs` (Section
        "Output arguments") for details.

    Returns
    -------
    rounded_array : ndarray
        An array of the same type as `a`, containing the rounded values.
        Unless `out` was specified, a new array is created.  A reference to
        the result is returned.

        The real and imaginary parts of complex numbers are rounded
        separately.  The result of rounding a float is a float.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.round : equivalent method

    ceil, fix, floor, rint, trunc


    Notes
    -----
    For values exactly halfway between rounded decimal values, NumPy
    rounds to the nearest even value. Thus 1.5 and 2.5 round to 2.0,
    -0.5 and 0.5 round to 0.0, etc. Results may also be surprising due
    to the inexact representation of decimal fractions in the IEEE
    floating point standard [1]_ and errors introduced when scaling
    by powers of ten.

    _reshape_dispatcher
    Find indices where elements should be inserted to maintain order.

    Find the indices into a sorted array `a` such that, if the
    corresponding elements in `v` were inserted before the indices, the
    order of `a` would be preserved.

    Assuming that `a` is sorted:

    ======  ============================
    `side`  returned index `i` satisfies
    ======  ============================
    left    ``a[i-1] < v <= a[i]``
    right   ``a[i-1] <= v < a[i]``
    ======  ============================

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : 1-D array_like
        Input array. If `sorter` is None, then it must be sorted in
        ascending order, otherwise `sorter` must be an array of indices
        that sort it.
    v : array_like
        Values to insert into `a`.
    side : {'left', 'right'}, optional
        If 'left', the index of the first suitable location found is given.
        If 'right', return the last such index.  If there is no suitable
        index, return either 0 or N (where N is the length of `a`).
    sorter : 1-D array_like, optional
        Optional array of integer indices that sort array a into ascending
        order. They are typically the result of argsort.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    indices : array of ints
        Array of insertion points with the same shape as `v`.

    See Also
    --------
    sort : Return a sorted copy of an array.
    histogram : Produce histogram from 1-D data.

    Notes
    -----
    Binary search is used to find the required insertion points.

    As of NumPy 1.4.0 `searchsorted` works with real/complex arrays containing
    `nan` values. The enhanced sort order is documented in `sort`.

    This function is a faster version of the builtin python `bisect.bisect_left`
    (``side='left'``) and `bisect.bisect_right` (``side='right'``) functions,
    which is also vectorized in the `v` argument.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.searchsorted([1,2,3,4,5], 3)
    2
    >>> np.searchsorted([1,2,3,4,5], 3, side='right')
    3
    >>> np.searchsorted([1,2,3,4,5], [-10, 10, 2, 3])
    array([0, 5, 1, 2])

    _any_dispatcher
    Return the product of array elements over a given axis.

    See Also
    --------
    prod : equivalent function; see for details.
    GeneratorType_linspace_dispatcher_logspace_dispatcher
    Return numbers spaced evenly on a log scale.

    In linear space, the sequence starts at ``base ** start``
    (`base` to the power of `start`) and ends with ``base ** stop``
    (see `endpoint` below).

    .. versionchanged:: 1.16.0
        Non-scalar `start` and `stop` are now supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : array_like
        ``base ** start`` is the starting value of the sequence.
    stop : array_like
        ``base ** stop`` is the final value of the sequence, unless `endpoint`
        is False.  In that case, ``num + 1`` values are spaced over the
        interval in log-space, of which all but the last (a sequence of
        length `num`) are returned.
    num : integer, optional
        Number of samples to generate.  Default is 50.
    endpoint : boolean, optional
        If true, `stop` is the last sample. Otherwise, it is not included.
        Default is True.
    base : float, optional
        The base of the log space. The step size between the elements in
        ``ln(samples) / ln(base)`` (or ``log_base(samples)``) is uniform.
        Default is 10.0.
    dtype : dtype
        The type of the output array.  If `dtype` is not given, infer the data
        type from the other input arguments.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis in the result to store the samples.  Relevant only if start
        or stop are array-like.  By default (0), the samples will be along a
        new axis inserted at the beginning. Use -1 to get an axis at the end.

        .. versionadded:: 1.16.0


    Returns
    -------
    samples : ndarray
        `num` samples, equally spaced on a log scale.

    See Also
    --------
    arange : Similar to linspace, with the step size specified instead of the
             number of samples. Note that, when used with a float endpoint, the
             endpoint may or may not be included.
    linspace : Similar to logspace, but with the samples uniformly distributed
               in linear space, instead of log space.
    geomspace : Similar to logspace, but with endpoints specified directly.

    Notes
    -----
    Logspace is equivalent to the code

    >>> y = np.linspace(start, stop, num=num, endpoint=endpoint)
    ... # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> power(base, y).astype(dtype)
    ... # doctest: +SKIP

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.logspace(2.0, 3.0, num=4)
    array([  100.        ,   215.443469  ,   464.15888336,  1000.        ])
    >>> np.logspace(2.0, 3.0, num=4, endpoint=False)

    >>> np.logspace(2.0, 3.0, num=4, base=2.0)
    array([ 4.        ,  5.0396842 ,  6.34960421,  8.        ])

    Graphical illustration:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> N = 10
    >>> x1 = np.logspace(0.1, 1, N, endpoint=True)
    >>> x2 = np.logspace(0.1, 1, N, endpoint=False)
    >>> y = np.zeros(N)
    >>> plt.plot(x1, y, 'o')

    >>> plt.ylim([-0.5, 1])
    (-0.5, 1)
    >>> plt.show()

    
    Return numbers spaced evenly on a log scale (a geometric progression).

    This is similar to `logspace`, but with endpoints specified directly.
    Each output sample is a constant multiple of the previous.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.16.0
        Non-scalar `start` and `stop` are now supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : array_like
        The starting value of the sequence.
    stop : array_like
        The final value of the sequence, unless `endpoint` is False.
        In that case, ``num + 1`` values are spaced over the
        interval in log-space, of which all but the last (a sequence of
        length `num`) are returned.
    num : integer, optional
        Number of samples to generate.  Default is 50.
    endpoint : boolean, optional
        If true, `stop` is the last sample. Otherwise, it is not included.
        Default is True.
    dtype : dtype
        The type of the output array.  If `dtype` is not given, infer the data
        type from the other input arguments.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis in the result to store the samples.  Relevant only if start
        or stop are array-like.  By default (0), the samples will be along a
        new axis inserted at the beginning. Use -1 to get an axis at the end.

        .. versionadded:: 1.16.0

    Returns
    -------
    samples : ndarray
        `num` samples, equally spaced on a log scale.

    See Also
    --------
    logspace : Similar to geomspace, but with endpoints specified using log
               and base.
    linspace : Similar to geomspace, but with arithmetic instead of geometric
               progression.
    arange : Similar to linspace, with the step size specified instead of the
             number of samples.

    Notes
    -----
    If the inputs or dtype are complex, the output will follow a logarithmic
    spiral in the complex plane.  (There are an infinite number of spirals
    passing through two points; the output will follow the shortest such path.)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.geomspace(1, 1000, num=4)
    array([    1.,    10.,   100.,  1000.])
    >>> np.geomspace(1, 1000, num=3, endpoint=False)
    array([   1.,   10.,  100.])
    >>> np.geomspace(1, 1000, num=4, endpoint=False)
    array([   1.        ,    5.62341325,   31.6227766 ,  177.827941  ])
    >>> np.geomspace(1, 256, num=9)
    array([   1.,    2.,    4.,    8.,   16.,   32.,   64.,  128.,  256.])

    Note that the above may not produce exact integers:

    >>> np.geomspace(1, 256, num=9, dtype=int)
    array([  1,   2,   4,   7,  16,  32,  63, 127, 256])
    >>> np.around(np.geomspace(1, 256, num=9)).astype(int)
    array([  1,   2,   4,   8,  16,  32,  64, 128, 256])

    Negative, decreasing, and complex inputs are allowed:

    >>> np.geomspace(1000, 1, num=4)
    array([ 1000.,   100.,    10.,     1.])
    >>> np.geomspace(-1000, -1, num=4)

    Adds documentation to obj which is in module place.

    If doc is a string add it to obj as a docstring

    If doc is a tuple, then the first element is interpreted as
       an attribute of obj and the second as the docstring
          (method, docstring)

    If doc is a list, then each element of the list should be a
       sequence of length two --> [(method1, docstring1),
       (method2, docstring2), ...]

    This routine never raises an error.

    This routine cannot modify read-only docstrings, as appear
    in new-style classes or built-in functions. Because this
    routine never raises an error the caller must check manually
    that the docstrings were changed.
    _geomspace_dispatcherlog_stopout_sign_mult_inplaceGeometric sequence cannot include zero
    Return evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval.

    Returns `num` evenly spaced samples, calculated over the
    interval [`start`, `stop`].

    The endpoint of the interval can optionally be excluded.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.16.0
        Non-scalar `start` and `stop` are now supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : array_like
        The starting value of the sequence.
    stop : array_like
        The end value of the sequence, unless `endpoint` is set to False.
        In that case, the sequence consists of all but the last of ``num + 1``
        evenly spaced samples, so that `stop` is excluded.  Note that the step
        size changes when `endpoint` is False.
    num : int, optional
        Number of samples to generate. Default is 50. Must be non-negative.
    endpoint : bool, optional
        If True, `stop` is the last sample. Otherwise, it is not included.
        Default is True.
    retstep : bool, optional
        If True, return (`samples`, `step`), where `step` is the spacing
        between samples.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        The type of the output array.  If `dtype` is not given, infer the data
        type from the other input arguments.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    axis : int, optional
        The axis in the result to store the samples.  Relevant only if start
        or stop are array-like.  By default (0), the samples will be along a
        new axis inserted at the beginning. Use -1 to get an axis at the end.

        .. versionadded:: 1.16.0

    Returns
    -------
    samples : ndarray
        There are `num` equally spaced samples in the closed interval
        ``[start, stop]`` or the half-open interval ``[start, stop)``
        (depending on whether `endpoint` is True or False).
    step : float, optional
        Only returned if `retstep` is True

        Size of spacing between samples.

             number of samples).
    geomspace : Similar to `linspace`, but with numbers spaced evenly on a log
                scale (a geometric progression).
    logspace : Similar to `geomspace`, but with the end points specified as

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.linspace(2.0, 3.0, num=5)
    array([ 2.  ,  2.25,  2.5 ,  2.75,  3.  ])
    >>> np.linspace(2.0, 3.0, num=5, endpoint=False)
    array([ 2. ,  2.2,  2.4,  2.6,  2.8])
    >>> np.linspace(2.0, 3.0, num=5, retstep=True)
    (array([ 2.  ,  2.25,  2.5 ,  2.75,  3.  ]), 0.25)

    Graphical illustration:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> N = 8
    >>> y = np.zeros(N)
    >>> x1 = np.linspace(0, 10, N, endpoint=True)
    >>> x2 = np.linspace(0, 10, N, endpoint=False)
    >>> plt.plot(x1, y, 'o')

    Notes
    -----
    For developers of NumPy: do not instantiate this at the module level.
    The initial calculation of these parameters is expensive and negatively
    impacts import times.  These objects are cached, so calling ``finfo()``
    repeatedly inside your functions is not a problem.

    Parameters
    ----------
    float_conv : function, optional
        Function that converts an integer or integer array to a float
        or float array. Default is `float`.
    int_conv : function, optional
        Function that converts a float or float array to an integer or
        integer array. Default is `int`.
    float_to_float : function, optional

        Write any changes in the array to the file on disk.

        For further information, see `memmap`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None

        See Also
        --------
        memmap

        memmap.__array_wrap__<module numpy.core.memmap>writeable_filemodesmemmap.__new__shape must be givenCreate a memory-map to an array stored in a *binary* file on disk.

    Memory-mapped files are used for accessing small segments of large files
    on disk, without reading the entire file into memory.  NumPy's
    memmap's are array-like objects.  This differs from Python's ``mmap``
    module, which uses file-like objects.

    This subclass of ndarray has some unpleasant interactions with
    some operations, because it doesn't quite fit properly as a subclass.
    An alternative to using this subclass is to create the ``mmap``
    object yourself, then create an ndarray with ndarray.__new__ directly,
    passing the object created in its 'buffer=' parameter.

    This class may at some point be turned into a factory function
    which returns a view into an mmap buffer.

    Delete the memmap instance to close the memmap file.


    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str, file-like object, or pathlib.Path instance
        The file name or file object to be used as the array data buffer.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The data-type used to interpret the file contents.
        Default is `uint8`.
    mode : {'r+', 'r', 'w+', 'c'}, optional
        The file is opened in this mode:

        +------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
        | 'r'  | Open existing file for reading only.                        |
        +------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
        | 'r+' | Open existing file for reading and writing.                 |
        +------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
        | 'w+' | Create or overwrite existing file for reading and writing.  |
        +------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
        | 'c'  | Copy-on-write: assignments affect data in memory, but       |
        |      | changes are not saved to disk.  The file on disk is         |
        |      | read-only.                                                  |
        +------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

        Default is 'r+'.
    offset : int, optional
        In the file, array data starts at this offset. Since `offset` is
        measured in bytes, it should normally be a multiple of the byte-size
        of `dtype`. When ``mode != 'r'``, even positive offsets beyond end of
        file are valid; The file will be extended to accommodate the
        additional data. By default, ``memmap`` will start at the beginning of
        the file, even if ``filename`` is a file pointer ``fp`` and
        ``fp.tell() != 0``.
    shape : tuple, optional
        The desired shape of the array. If ``mode == 'r'`` and the number
        of remaining bytes after `offset` is not a multiple of the byte-size
        of `dtype`, you must specify `shape`. By default, the returned array
        will be 1-D with the number of elements determined by file size
        and data-type.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
        Specify the order of the ndarray memory layout:
        :term:`row-major`, C-style or :term:`column-major`,
        Fortran-style.  This only has an effect if the shape is
        greater than 1-D.  The default order is 'C'.

    Attributes
    ----------
    filename : str or pathlib.Path instance
        Path to the mapped file.
    offset : int
        Offset position in the file.
    mode : str
        File mode.

    Methods
    -------
    flush
        Flush any changes in memory to file on disk.
        When you delete a memmap object, flush is called first to write
        changes to disk before removing the object.

    --------
    lib.format.open_memmap : Create or load a memory-mapped ``.npy`` file.

    Notes
    -----
    The memmap object can be used anywhere an ndarray is accepted.
    Given a memmap ``fp``, ``isinstance(fp, numpy.ndarray)`` returns
    ``True``.
    
    Memory-mapped files cannot be larger than 2GB on 32-bit systems.

    When a memmap causes a file to be created or extended beyond its
    current size in the filesystem, the contents of the new part are
    unspecified. On systems with POSIX filesystem semantics, the extended
    part will be filled with zero bytes.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> data = np.arange(12, dtype='float32')
    >>> data.resize((3,4))

    This example uses a temporary file so that doctest doesn't write
    files to your directory. You would use a 'normal' filename.

    >>> from tempfile import mkdtemp
    >>> import os.path as path
    >>> filename = path.join(mkdtemp(), 'newfile.dat')

    Create a memmap with dtype and shape that matches our data:

    >>> fp = np.memmap(filename, dtype='float32', mode='w+', shape=(3,4))
    >>> fp
    memmap([[ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
            [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
            [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.]], dtype=float32)

    Write data to memmap array:

    >>> fp[:] = data[:]
    >>> fp
    memmap([[  0.,   1.,   2.,   3.],
            [  4.,   5.,   6.,   7.],
            [  8.,   9.,  10.,  11.]], dtype=float32)

    >>> fp.filename == path.abspath(filename)
    True

    Deletion flushes memory changes to disk before removing the object:

    >>> del fp

    Load the memmap and verify data was stored:

    >>> newfp = np.memmap(filename, dtype='float32', mode='r', shape=(3,4))
    >>> newfp
    memmap([[  0.,   1.,   2.,   3.],
            [  4.,   5.,   6.,   7.],
            [  8.,   9.,  10.,  11.]], dtype=float32)

    Read-only memmap:

    >>> fpr = np.memmap(filename, dtype='float32', mode='r', shape=(3,4))
    >>> fpr.flags.writeable
    False

    Copy-on-write memmap:

    >>> fpc = np.memmap(filename, dtype='float32', mode='c', shape=(3,4))
    >>> fpc.flags.writeable
    True

    It's possible to assign to copy-on-write array, but values are only
    written into the memory copy of the array, and not written to disk:

    >>> fpc
    memmap([[  0.,   1.,   2.,   3.],
            [  4.,   5.,   6.,   7.],
            [  8.,   9.,  10.,  11.]], dtype=float32)
    >>> fpc[0,:] = 0
    >>> fpc
    memmap([[  0.,   0.,   0.,   0.],
            [  4.,   5.,   6.,   7.],
            [  8.,   9.,  10.,  11.]], dtype=float32)

    File on disk is unchanged:

    >>> fpr
    memmap([[  0.,   1.,   2.,   3.],
            [  4.,   5.,   6.,   7.],
            [  8.,   9.,  10.,  11.]], dtype=float32)

    Offset into a memmap:

    >>> fpo = np.memmap(filename, dtype='float32', mode='r', offset=16)
    >>> fpo
    memmap([  4.,   5.,   6.,   7.,   8.,   9.,  10.,  11.], dtype=float32)

    mode_equivalentsdtypedescrprototype
    can_cast(from_, to, casting='safe')

    Returns True if cast between data types can occur according to the
    casting rule.  If from is a scalar or array scalar, also returns
    True if the scalar value can be cast without overflow or truncation
    to an integer.

    Parameters
    ----------
    from_ : dtype, dtype specifier, scalar, or array
        Data type, scalar, or array to cast from.
    to : dtype or dtype specifier
        Data type to cast to.
    casting : {'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}, optional
        Controls what kind of data casting may occur.

          * 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.
          * 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.
          * 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
          * 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,
            like float64 to float32, are allowed.
          * 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.

    Returns
    -------
    out : bool
        True if cast can occur according to the casting rule.

    Notes
    -----
    Starting in NumPy 1.9, can_cast function now returns False in 'safe'
    casting mode for integer/float dtype and string dtype if the string dtype
    length is not long enough to store the max integer/float value converted
    to a string. Previously can_cast in 'safe' mode returned True for
    integer/float dtype and a string dtype of any length.

    myarray_ARRAY_API'shape' argument should be used instead of 'dims'/home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/core/multiarray.py
    dot(a, b, out=None)

    Dot product of two arrays. Specifically,

    - If both `a` and `b` are 1-D arrays, it is inner product of vectors
      (without complex conjugation).

    - If both `a` and `b` are 2-D arrays, it is matrix multiplication,
      but using :func:`matmul` or ``a @ b`` is preferred.

    - If either `a` or `b` is 0-D (scalar), it is equivalent to :func:`multiply`
      and using ``numpy.multiply(a, b)`` or ``a * b`` is preferred.

    - If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is a 1-D array, it is a sum product over
      the last axis of `a` and `b`.

    - If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is an M-D array (where ``M>=2``), it is a
      sum product over the last axis of `a` and the second-to-last axis of `b`::

        dot(a, b)[i,j,k,m] = sum(a[i,j,:] * b[k,:,m])

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        First argument.
    b : array_like
        Second argument.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Output argument. This must have the exact kind that would be returned
        if it was not used. In particular, it must have the right type, must be
        C-contiguous, and its dtype must be the dtype that would be returned
        for `dot(a,b)`. This is a performance feature. Therefore, if these
        conditions are not met, an exception is raised, instead of attempting
        to be flexible.

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        Returns the dot product of `a` and `b`.  If `a` and `b` are both
        scalars or both 1-D arrays then a scalar is returned; otherwise
        an array is returned.
        If `out` is given, then it is returned.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the last dimension of `a` is not the same size as
        the second-to-last dimension of `b`.

    See Also
    --------
    vdot : Complex-conjugating dot product.
    tensordot : Sum products over arbitrary axes.
    einsum : Einstein summation convention.
    matmul : '@' operator as method with out parameter.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.dot(3, 4)
    12

    Neither argument is complex-conjugated:

    >>> np.dot([2j, 3j], [2j, 3j])
    (-13+0j)

    For 2-D arrays it is the matrix product:

    >>> a = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
    >>> b = [[4, 1], [2, 2]]
    >>> np.dot(a, b)
    array([[4, 1],
           [2, 2]])

    >>> a = np.arange(3*4*5*6).reshape((3,4,5,6))
    >>> b = np.arange(3*4*5*6)[::-1].reshape((5,4,6,3))
    >>> np.dot(a, b)[2,3,2,1,2,2]
    499128
    >>> sum(a[2,3,2,:] * b[1,2,:,2])
    499128

    
    vdot(a, b)

    Return the dot product of two vectors.

    The vdot(`a`, `b`) function handles complex numbers differently than
    dot(`a`, `b`).  If the first argument is complex the complex conjugate
    of the first argument is used for the calculation of the dot product.

    Note that `vdot` handles multidimensional arrays differently than `dot`:
    it does *not* perform a matrix product, but flattens input arguments
    to 1-D vectors first. Consequently, it should only be used for vectors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        If `a` is complex the complex conjugate is taken before calculation
        of the dot product.
    b : array_like
        Second argument to the dot product.

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        Dot product of `a` and `b`.  Can be an int, float, or
        complex depending on the types of `a` and `b`.

    See Also
    --------
    dot : Return the dot product without using the complex conjugate of the
          first argument.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([1+2j,3+4j])
    >>> b = np.array([5+6j,7+8j])
    >>> np.vdot(a, b)
    (70-8j)
    >>> np.vdot(b, a)
    (70+8j)

    Note that higher-dimensional arrays are flattened!

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 4], [5, 6]])
    >>> b = np.array([[4, 1], [2, 2]])
    >>> np.vdot(a, b)
    30
    >>> np.vdot(b, a)
    30
    >>> 1*4 + 4*1 + 5*2 + 6*2
    30

    
    empty_like(prototype, dtype=None, order='K', subok=True)

    Return a new array with the same shape and type as a given array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    prototype : array_like
        The shape and data-type of `prototype` define these same attributes
        of the returned array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Overrides the data type of the result.

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A', or 'K'}, optional
        Overrides the memory layout of the result. 'C' means C-order,
        'F' means F-order, 'A' means 'F' if ``prototype`` is Fortran
        contiguous, 'C' otherwise. 'K' means match the layout of ``prototype``
        as closely as possible.

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0
    subok : bool, optional.
        If True, then the newly created array will use the sub-class
        type of 'a', otherwise it will be a base-class array. Defaults
        to True.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of uninitialized (arbitrary) data with the same
        shape and type as `prototype`.

    See Also
    --------
    ones_like : Return an array of ones with shape and type of input.
    zeros_like : Return an array of zeros with shape and type of input.
    full_like : Return a new array with shape of input filled with value.
    empty : Return a new uninitialized array.

    Notes
    -----
    This function does *not* initialize the returned array; to do that use
    `zeros_like` or `ones_like` instead.  It may be marginally faster than
    the functions that do set the array values.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = ([1,2,3], [4,5,6])                         # a is array-like
    >>> np.empty_like(a)
    array([[-1073741821, -1073741821,           3],    #random
           [          0,           0, -1073741821]])
    >>> a = np.array([[1., 2., 3.],[4.,5.,6.]])
    >>> np.empty_like(a)
    array([[ -2.00000715e+000,   1.48219694e-323,  -2.00000572e+000],#random
           [  4.38791518e-305,  -2.00000715e+000,   4.17269252e-309]])

max_work<module numpy.core.multiarray>
    copyto(dst, src, casting='same_kind', where=True)

    Copies values from one array to another, broadcasting as necessary.

    Raises a TypeError if the `casting` rule is violated, and if
    `where` is provided, it selects which elements to copy.

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    dst : ndarray
        The array into which values are copied.
    src : array_like
        The array from which values are copied.
    casting : {'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}, optional
        Controls what kind of data casting may occur when copying.

          * 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.
          * 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.
          * 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
          * 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,
            like float64 to float32, are allowed.
          * 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.
    where : array_like of bool, optional
        A boolean array which is broadcasted to match the dimensions
        of `dst`, and selects elements to copy from `src` to `dst`
        wherever it contains the value True.
    
    datetime_as_string(arr, unit=None, timezone='naive', casting='same_kind')

    Convert an array of datetimes into an array of strings.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array_like of datetime64
        The array of UTC timestamps to format.
    unit : str
        One of None, 'auto', or a :ref:`datetime unit <arrays.dtypes.dateunits>`.
    timezone : {'naive', 'UTC', 'local'} or tzinfo
        Timezone information to use when displaying the datetime. If 'UTC', end
        with a Z to indicate UTC time. If 'local', convert to the local timezone
        first, and suffix with a +-#### timezone offset. If a tzinfo object,
        then do as with 'local', but use the specified timezone.
    casting : {'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}
        Casting to allow when changing between datetime units.

    Returns
    -------
    str_arr : ndarray
        An array of strings the same shape as `arr`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> d = np.arange('2002-10-27T04:30', 4*60, 60, dtype='M8[m]')
    >>> d
    array(['2002-10-27T04:30', '2002-10-27T05:30', '2002-10-27T06:30',
           '2002-10-27T07:30'], dtype='datetime64[m]')

    Setting the timezone to UTC shows the same information, but with a Z suffix

    >>> np.datetime_as_string(d, timezone='UTC')
    array(['2002-10-27T04:30Z', '2002-10-27T05:30Z', '2002-10-27T06:30Z',
           '2002-10-27T07:30Z'], dtype='<U35')

    Note that we picked datetimes that cross a DST boundary. Passing in a
    ``pytz`` timezone object will print the appropriate offset

    >>> np.datetime_as_string(d, timezone=pytz.timezone('US/Eastern'))
    array(['2002-10-27T00:30-0400', '2002-10-27T01:30-0400',
           '2002-10-27T01:30-0500', '2002-10-27T02:30-0500'], dtype='<U39')

    Passing in a unit will change the precision

    >>> np.datetime_as_string(d, unit='h')
    array(['2002-10-27T04', '2002-10-27T05', '2002-10-27T06', '2002-10-27T07'],
          dtype='<U32')
    >>> np.datetime_as_string(d, unit='s')
    array(['2002-10-27T04:30:00', '2002-10-27T05:30:00', '2002-10-27T06:30:00',
           '2002-10-27T07:30:00'], dtype='<U38')

    'casting' can be used to specify whether precision can be changed

    >>> np.datetime_as_string(d, unit='h', casting='safe')
    TypeError: Cannot create a datetime string as units 'h' from a NumPy
    datetime with units 'm' according to the rule 'safe'
    
    busday_offset(dates, offsets, roll='raise', weekmask='1111100', holidays=None, busdaycal=None, out=None)

    First adjusts the date to fall on a valid day according to
    the ``roll`` rule, then applies offsets to the given dates
    counted in valid days.

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    dates : array_like of datetime64[D]
        The array of dates to process.
    offsets : array_like of int
        The array of offsets, which is broadcast with ``dates``.
    roll : {'raise', 'nat', 'forward', 'following', 'backward', 'preceding', 'modifiedfollowing', 'modifiedpreceding'}, optional
        How to treat dates that do not fall on a valid day. The default
        is 'raise'.

          * 'raise' means to raise an exception for an invalid day.
          * 'nat' means to return a NaT (not-a-time) for an invalid day.
          * 'forward' and 'following' mean to take the first valid day
            later in time.
          * 'backward' and 'preceding' mean to take the first valid day
            earlier in time.
          * 'modifiedfollowing' means to take the first valid day
            later in time unless it is across a Month boundary, in which
            case to take the first valid day earlier in time.
          * 'modifiedpreceding' means to take the first valid day
            earlier in time unless it is across a Month boundary, in which
            case to take the first valid day later in time.
    weekmask : str or array_like of bool, optional
        A seven-element array indicating which of Monday through Sunday are
        valid days. May be specified as a length-seven list or array, like
        [1,1,1,1,1,0,0]; a length-seven string, like '1111100'; or a string
        like "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri", made up of 3-character abbreviations for
        weekdays, optionally separated by white space. Valid abbreviations
        are: Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun
    holidays : array_like of datetime64[D], optional
        An array of dates to consider as invalid dates.  They may be
        specified in any order, and NaT (not-a-time) dates are ignored.
        This list is saved in a normalized form that is suited for
        fast calculations of valid days.
    busdaycal : busdaycalendar, optional
        A `busdaycalendar` object which specifies the valid days. If this
        parameter is provided, neither weekmask nor holidays may be
        provided.
    out : array of datetime64[D], optional
        If provided, this array is filled with the result.

    Returns
    -------
    out : array of datetime64[D]
        An array with a shape from broadcasting ``dates`` and ``offsets``
        together, containing the dates with offsets applied.

    See Also
    --------
    busdaycalendar: An object that specifies a custom set of valid days.
    is_busday : Returns a boolean array indicating valid days.
    busday_count : Counts how many valid days are in a half-open date range.

    numpy.datetime64('2011-03-23','D')
    
    unravel_index(indices, shape, order='C')

    Converts a flat index or array of flat indices into a tuple
    of coordinate arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    indices : array_like
        An integer array whose elements are indices into the flattened
        version of an array of dimensions ``shape``. Before version 1.6.0,
        this function accepted just one index value.
    shape : tuple of ints
        The shape of the array to use for unraveling ``indices``.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.16.0
            Renamed from ``dims`` to ``shape``.

    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
        Determines whether the indices should be viewed as indexing in
        row-major (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) order.

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    Returns
    -------
    unraveled_coords : tuple of ndarray
        Each array in the tuple has the same shape as the ``indices``
        array.

    See Also
    --------
    ravel_multi_index

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.unravel_index([22, 41, 37], (7,6))
    (array([3, 6, 6]), array([4, 5, 1]))
    >>> np.unravel_index([31, 41, 13], (7,6), order='F')
    (array([3, 6, 6]), array([4, 5, 1]))

    >>> np.unravel_index(1621, (6,7,8,9))
    (3, 1, 4, 1)

    array_function_from_c_func_and_dispatcher
    ravel_multi_index(multi_index, dims, mode='raise', order='C')

    Converts a tuple of index arrays into an array of flat
    indices, applying boundary modes to the multi-index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    multi_index : tuple of array_like
        A tuple of integer arrays, one array for each dimension.
    dims : tuple of ints
        The shape of array into which the indices from ``multi_index`` apply.
    mode : {'raise', 'wrap', 'clip'}, optional
        Specifies how out-of-bounds indices are handled.  Can specify
        either one mode or a tuple of modes, one mode per index.

        * 'raise' -- raise an error (default)
        * 'wrap' -- wrap around
        * 'clip' -- clip to the range

        In 'clip' mode, a negative index which would normally
        wrap will clip to 0 instead.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
        Determines whether the multi-index should be viewed as
        indexing in row-major (C-style) or column-major
        (Fortran-style) order.

    Returns
    -------
    raveled_indices : ndarray
        An array of indices into the flattened version of an array
        of dimensions ``dims``.

    result_type(*arrays_and_dtypes)

    Returns the type that results from applying the NumPy
    type promotion rules to the arguments.

    Type promotion in NumPy works similarly to the rules in languages
    like C++, with some slight differences.  When both scalars and
    arrays are used, the array's type takes precedence and the actual value
    of the scalar is taken into account.

    For example, calculating 3*a, where a is an array of 32-bit floats,
    intuitively should result in a 32-bit float output.  If the 3 is a
    32-bit integer, the NumPy rules indicate it can't convert losslessly
    into a 32-bit float, so a 64-bit float should be the result type.
    By examining the value of the constant, '3', we see that it fits in
    an 8-bit integer, which can be cast losslessly into the 32-bit float.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arrays_and_dtypes : list of arrays and dtypes
        The operands of some operation whose result type is needed.

    Returns
    -------
    out : dtype
        The result type.

    See also
    --------
    dtype, promote_types, min_scalar_type, can_cast

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    The specific algorithm used is as follows.

    Categories are determined by first checking which of boolean,
    integer (int/uint), or floating point (float/complex) the maximum
    kind of all the arrays and the scalars are.

    If there are only scalars or the maximum category of the scalars
    is higher than the maximum category of the arrays,
    the data types are combined with :func:`promote_types`
    to produce the return value.

    Otherwise, `min_scalar_type` is called on each array, and
    the resulting data types are all combined with :func:`promote_types`
    to produce the return value.

    The set of int values is not a subset of the uint values for types
    with the same number of bits, something not reflected in
    :func:`min_scalar_type`, but handled as a special case in `result_type`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.result_type(3, np.arange(7, dtype='i1'))
    dtype('int8')

    >>> np.result_type('i4', 'c8')
    dtype('complex128')

    >>> np.result_type(3.0, -2)
    dtype('float64')

    
    concatenate((a1, a2, ...), axis=0, out=None)

    Join a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a1, a2, ... : sequence of array_like
        The arrays must have the same shape, except in the dimension
        corresponding to `axis` (the first, by default).
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which the arrays will be joined.  If axis is None,
        arrays are flattened before use.  Default is 0.
    out : ndarray, optional
        If provided, the destination to place the result. The shape must be
        correct, matching that of what concatenate would have returned if no
        out argument were specified.

    Returns
    -------
    res : ndarray
        The concatenated array.

    See Also
    --------
    ma.concatenate : Concatenate function that preserves input masks.
    array_split : Split an array into multiple sub-arrays of equal or
                  near-equal size.
    split : Split array into a list of multiple sub-arrays of equal size.
    hsplit : Split array into multiple sub-arrays horizontally (column wise)
    vsplit : Split array into multiple sub-arrays vertically (row wise)
    dsplit : Split array into multiple sub-arrays along the 3rd axis (depth).
    stack : Stack a sequence of arrays along a new axis.
    hstack : Stack arrays in sequence horizontally (column wise)
    vstack : Stack arrays in sequence vertically (row wise)
    dstack : Stack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third dimension)
    block : Assemble arrays from blocks.

    Notes
    -----
    When one or more of the arrays to be concatenated is a MaskedArray,
    this function will return a MaskedArray object instead of an ndarray,
    but the input masks are *not* preserved. In cases where a MaskedArray
    is expected as input, use the ma.concatenate function from the masked
    array module instead.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> b = np.array([[5, 6]])
    >>> np.concatenate((a, b), axis=0)
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4],
           [5, 6]])
    >>> np.concatenate((a, b.T), axis=1)
    array([[1, 2, 5],
           [3, 4, 6]])
    >>> np.concatenate((a, b), axis=None)
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

    This function will not preserve masking of MaskedArray inputs.

    >>> a = np.ma.arange(3)
    >>> a[1] = np.ma.masked
    >>> b = np.arange(2, 5)
    >>> a
    masked_array(data=[0, --, 2],
                 mask=[False,  True, False],
           fill_value=999999)
    >>> b
    array([2, 3, 4])
    >>> np.concatenate([a, b])
    masked_array(data=[0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4],
                 mask=False,
           fill_value=999999)
    >>> np.ma.concatenate([a, b])
    masked_array(data=[0, --, 2, 2, 3, 4],
                 mask=[False,  True, False, False, False, False],
           fill_value=999999)

    
    bincount(x, weights=None, minlength=0)

    Count number of occurrences of each value in array of non-negative ints.

    The number of bins (of size 1) is one larger than the largest value in
    `x`. If `minlength` is specified, there will be at least this number
    of bins in the output array (though it will be longer if necessary,
    depending on the contents of `x`).
    Each bin gives the number of occurrences of its index value in `x`.
    If `weights` is specified the input array is weighted by it, i.e. if a
    value ``n`` is found at position ``i``, ``out[n] += weight[i]`` instead
    of ``out[n] += 1``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, 1 dimension, nonnegative ints
        Input array.
    weights : array_like, optional
        Weights, array of the same shape as `x`.
    minlength : int, optional
        A minimum number of bins for the output array.

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray of ints
        The result of binning the input array.
        The length of `out` is equal to ``np.amax(x)+1``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the input is not 1-dimensional, or contains elements with negative
        values, or if `minlength` is negative.
    TypeError
        If the type of the input is float or complex.

    See Also
    --------
    histogram, digitize, unique

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.bincount(np.arange(5))
    array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
    >>> np.bincount(np.array([0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 7]))
    array([1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1])

    >>> x = np.array([0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 7, 23])
    >>> np.bincount(x).size == np.amax(x)+1
    True

    The input array needs to be of integer dtype, otherwise a
    TypeError is raised:

    >>> np.bincount(np.arange(5, dtype=float))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: array cannot be safely cast to required type

    A possible use of ``bincount`` is to perform sums over
    variable-size chunks of an array, using the ``weights`` keyword.

    >>> w = np.array([0.3, 0.5, 0.2, 0.7, 1., -0.6]) # weights
    >>> x = np.array([0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2])
    >>> np.bincount(x,  weights=w)
    array([ 0.3,  0.7,  1.1])

    
    lexsort(keys, axis=-1)

    Perform an indirect stable sort using a sequence of keys.

    Given multiple sorting keys, which can be interpreted as columns in a
    spreadsheet, lexsort returns an array of integer indices that describes
    the sort order by multiple columns. The last key in the sequence is used
    for the primary sort order, the second-to-last key for the secondary sort
    order, and so on. The keys argument must be a sequence of objects that
    can be converted to arrays of the same shape. If a 2D array is provided
    for the keys argument, it's rows are interpreted as the sorting keys and
    sorting is according to the last row, second last row etc.

    Parameters
    ----------
    keys : (k, N) array or tuple containing k (N,)-shaped sequences
        The `k` different "columns" to be sorted.  The last column (or row if
        `keys` is a 2D array) is the primary sort key.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis to be indirectly sorted.  By default, sort over the last axis.

    Returns
    -------
    indices : (N,) ndarray of ints
        Array of indices that sort the keys along the specified axis.

    See Also
    --------
    argsort : Indirect sort.
    ndarray.sort : In-place sort.
    sort : Return a sorted copy of an array.

    Examples
    --------
    Sort names: first by surname, then by name.

    >>> surnames =    ('Hertz',    'Galilei', 'Hertz')
    >>> first_names = ('Heinrich', 'Galileo', 'Gustav')
    >>> ind = np.lexsort((first_names, surnames))
    >>> ind
    array([1, 2, 0])

    >>> [surnames[i] + ", " + first_names[i] for i in ind]
    ['Galilei, Galileo', 'Hertz, Gustav', 'Hertz, Heinrich']

    Sort two columns of numbers:

    >>> a = [1,5,1,4,3,4,4] # First column
    >>> b = [9,4,0,4,0,2,1] # Second column
    >>> ind = np.lexsort((b,a)) # Sort by a, then by b
    >>> print(ind)
    [2 0 4 6 5 3 1]

    >>> [(a[i],b[i]) for i in ind]
    [(1, 0), (1, 9), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 4)]

    Note that sorting is first according to the elements of ``a``.
    Secondary sorting is according to the elements of ``b``.

    A normal ``argsort`` would have yielded:

    >>> [(a[i],b[i]) for i in np.argsort(a)]
    [(1, 9), (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 4), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 4)]

    Structured arrays are sorted lexically by ``argsort``:

    >>> x = np.array([(1,9), (5,4), (1,0), (4,4), (3,0), (4,2), (4,1)],
    ...              dtype=np.dtype([('x', int), ('y', int)]))

    >>> np.argsort(x) # or np.argsort(x, order=('x', 'y'))

    busday_count(begindates, enddates, weekmask='1111100', holidays=[], busdaycal=None, out=None)

    Counts the number of valid days between `begindates` and
    `enddates`, not including the day of `enddates`.

    If ``enddates`` specifies a date value that is earlier than the
    corresponding ``begindates`` date value, the count will be negative.

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    begindates : array_like of datetime64[D]
        The array of the first dates for counting.
    enddates : array_like of datetime64[D]
        The array of the end dates for counting, which are excluded
        from the count themselves.
    weekmask : str or array_like of bool, optional

    array([False, False,  True], dtype='bool')
    
    inner(a, b)

    Inner product of two arrays.

    Ordinary inner product of vectors for 1-D arrays (without complex
    conjugation), in higher dimensions a sum product over the last axes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : array_like
        If `a` and `b` are nonscalar, their last dimensions must match.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        `out.shape = a.shape[:-1] + b.shape[:-1]`

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the last dimension of `a` and `b` has different size.

    See Also
    --------
    tensordot : Sum products over arbitrary axes.
    dot : Generalised matrix product, using second last dimension of `b`.
    einsum : Einstein summation convention.

    Notes
    -----
    For vectors (1-D arrays) it computes the ordinary inner-product::

        np.inner(a, b) = sum(a[:]*b[:])

    More generally, if `ndim(a) = r > 0` and `ndim(b) = s > 0`::

        np.inner(a, b) = np.tensordot(a, b, axes=(-1,-1))

    or explicitly::

        np.inner(a, b)[i0,...,ir-1,j0,...,js-1]
             = sum(a[i0,...,ir-1,:]*b[j0,...,js-1,:])

    In addition `a` or `b` may be scalars, in which case::

       np.inner(a,b) = a*b

    Examples
    --------
    Ordinary inner product for vectors:

    >>> a = np.array([1,2,3])
    >>> b = np.array([0,1,0])
    >>> np.inner(a, b)
    2

    A multidimensional example:

    >>> a = np.arange(24).reshape((2,3,4))
    >>> b = np.arange(4)
    >>> np.inner(a, b)
    array([[ 14,  38,  62],
           [ 86, 110, 134]])

    An example where `b` is a scalar:

    >>> np.inner(np.eye(2), 7)
    array([[ 7.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  7.]])

    
    where(condition, [x, y])

    Return elements chosen from `x` or `y` depending on `condition`.

    .. note::
        When only `condition` is provided, this function is a shorthand for
        ``np.asarray(condition).nonzero()``. Using `nonzero` directly should be
        preferred, as it behaves correctly for subclasses. The rest of this
        documentation covers only the case where all three arguments are
        provided.

    Parameters
    ----------
    condition : array_like, bool
        Where True, yield `x`, otherwise yield `y`.
    x, y : array_like
        Values from which to choose. `x`, `y` and `condition` need to be
        broadcastable to some shape.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        An array with elements from `x` where `condition` is True, and elements
        from `y` elsewhere.

    See Also
    --------
    choose
    nonzero : The function that is called when x and y are omitted

    Notes
    -----
    If all the arrays are 1-D, `where` is equivalent to::

        [xv if c else yv
         for c, xv, yv in zip(condition, x, y)]

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(10)
    >>> a
    array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
    >>> np.where(a < 5, a, 10*a)
    array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90])

    This can be used on multidimensional arrays too:

    >>> np.where([[True, False], [True, True]],
    ...          [[1, 2], [3, 4]],
    ...          [[9, 8], [7, 6]])
    array([[1, 8],
           [3, 4]])

    The shapes of x, y, and the condition are broadcast together:

    >>> x, y = np.ogrid[:3, :4]
    >>> np.where(x < y, x, 10 + y)  # both x and 10+y are broadcast
    array([[10,  0,  0,  0],
           [10, 11,  1,  1],
           [10, 11, 12,  2]])

    >>> a = np.array([[0, 1, 2],
    ...               [0, 2, 4],
    ...               [0, 3, 6]])
    >>> np.where(a < 4, a, -1)  # -1 is broadcast
    array([[ 0,  1,  2],
           [ 0,  2, -1],
           [ 0,  3, -1]])
    
    min_scalar_type(a)

    For scalar ``a``, returns the data type with the smallest size
    and smallest scalar kind which can hold its value.  For non-scalar
    array ``a``, returns the vector's dtype unmodified.

    Floating point values are not demoted to integers,
    and complex values are not demoted to floats.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : scalar or array_like
        The value whose minimal data type is to be found.

    Returns
    -------
    out : dtype
        The minimal data type.

    Compute the outer product of two vectors.

    Given two vectors, ``a = [a0, a1, ..., aM]`` and
    ``b = [b0, b1, ..., bN]``,

    rollaxisaxisc`source` and `destination` arguments must have the same number of elementsallow_duplicatearray_equal_full_like_dispatcher_tensordot_dispatcherargnamebinary_repr.<locals>.warn_if_insufficient_maketup
    Counts the number of non-zero values in the array ``a``.

    The word "non-zero" is in reference to the Python 2.x
    built-in method ``__nonzero__()`` (renamed ``__bool__()``
    in Python 3.x) of Python objects that tests an object's
    "truthfulness". For example, any number is considered
    truthful if it is nonzero, whereas any string is considered
    truthful if it is not the empty string. Thus, this function
    (recursively) counts how many elements in ``a`` (and in
    sub-arrays thereof) have their ``__nonzero__()`` or ``__bool__()``
    method evaluated to ``True``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The array for which to count non-zeros.
    axis : int or tuple, optional
        Axis or tuple of axes along which to count non-zeros.
        Default is None, meaning that non-zeros will be counted
        along a flattened version of ``a``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.12.0

    Returns
    -------
    count : int or array of int
        Number of non-zero values in the array along a given axis.
        Otherwise, the total number of non-zero values in the array
        is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    nonzero : Return the coordinates of all the non-zero values.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.count_nonzero(np.eye(4))
    4
    >>> np.count_nonzero([[0,1,7,0,0],[3,0,0,2,19]])

    >>> np.count_nonzero([[0,1,7,0,0],[3,0,0,2,19]], axis=1)
    array([2, 3])

    
    Return the cross product of two (arrays of) vectors.

    The cross product of `a` and `b` in :math:`R^3` is a vector perpendicular
    to both `a` and `b`.  If `a` and `b` are arrays of vectors, the vectors
    are defined by the last axis of `a` and `b` by default, and these axes
    can have dimensions 2 or 3.  Where the dimension of either `a` or `b` is
    2, the third component of the input vector is assumed to be zero and the
    cross product calculated accordingly.  In cases where both input vectors
    have dimension 2, the z-component of the cross product is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Components of the first vector(s).
    b : array_like
        Components of the second vector(s).
    axisa : int, optional
        Axis of `a` that defines the vector(s).  By default, the last axis.
    axisb : int, optional
        Axis of `b` that defines the vector(s).  By default, the last axis.
    axisc : int, optional
        Axis of `c` containing the cross product vector(s).  Ignored if
        both input vectors have dimension 2, as the return is scalar.
        By default, the last axis.
    axis : int, optional
        If defined, the axis of `a`, `b` and `c` that defines the vector(s)
        and cross product(s).  Overrides `axisa`, `axisb` and `axisc`.

    Returns
    -------
    c : ndarray
        Vector cross product(s).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When the dimension of the vector(s) in `a` and/or `b` does not
        equal 2 or 3.

    >>> x = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> y = [4, 5, 6]
    >>> np.cross(x, y)
    array([-3,  6, -3])

    One vector with dimension 2.

    >>> x = [1, 2]
    >>> y = [4, 5, 6]
    >>> np.cross(x, y)
    array([12, -6, -3])

    Equivalently:

    >>> x = [1, 2, 0]
    >>> y = [4, 5, 6]
    >>> np.cross(x, y)
    array([12, -6, -3])

    Both vectors with dimension 2.

    >>> x = [1,2]
    >>> y = [4,5]
    >>> np.cross(x, y)
    -3

    Multiple vector cross-products. Note that the direction of the cross
    product vector is defined by the `right-hand rule`.

    >>> x = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
    >>> y = np.array([[4,5,6], [1,2,3]])
    >>> np.cross(x, y)

    argwherepossible_flags_outer_dispatcher
    Returns the discrete, linear convolution of two one-dimensional sequences.

    The convolution operator is often seen in signal processing, where it
    models the effect of a linear time-invariant system on a signal [1]_.  In
    probability theory, the sum of two independent random variables is
    distributed according to the convolution of their individual
    distributions.

    If `v` is longer than `a`, the arrays are swapped before computation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (N,) array_like
        First one-dimensional input array.
    v : (M,) array_like
        Second one-dimensional input array.
    mode : {'full', 'valid', 'same'}, optional
        'full':
          By default, mode is 'full'.  This returns the convolution
          at each point of overlap, with an output shape of (N+M-1,). At
          the end-points of the convolution, the signals do not overlap
          completely, and boundary effects may be seen.

        'same':
          Mode 'same' returns output of length ``max(M, N)``.  Boundary
          effects are still visible.

        'valid':
          Mode 'valid' returns output of length
          ``max(M, N) - min(M, N) + 1``.  The convolution product is only given
          for points where the signals overlap completely.  Values outside
          the signal boundary have no effect.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Discrete, linear convolution of `a` and `v`.

                               Transform.
    scipy.linalg.toeplitz : Used to construct the convolution operator.
    polymul : Polynomial multiplication. Same output as convolve, but also
              accepts poly1d objects as input.

    Notes
    -----
    The discrete convolution operation is defined as

    .. math:: (a * v)[n] = \sum_{m = -\infty}^{\infty} a[m] v[n - m]

    It can be shown that a convolution :math:`x(t) * y(t)` in time/space
    is equivalent to the multiplication :math:`X(f) Y(f)` in the Fourier
    domain, after appropriate padding (padding is necessary to prevent
    circular convolution).  Since multiplication is more efficient (faster)
    than convolution, the function `scipy.signal.fftconvolve` exploits the
    FFT to calculate the convolution of large data-sets.

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution

    Examples
    --------
    Note how the convolution operator flips the second array
    before "sliding" the two across one another:

    >>> np.convolve([1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 0.5])
    array([ 0. ,  1. ,  2.5,  4. ,  1.5])

    Only return the middle values of the convolution.
    Contains boundary effects, where zeros are taken
    into account:

    >>> np.convolve([1,2,3],[0,1,0.5], 'same')
    array([ 1. ,  2.5,  4. ])

    The two arrays are of the same length, so there
    is only one position where they completely overlap:

    >>> np.convolve([1,2,3],[0,1,0.5], 'valid')
    array([ 2.5])

    within_tolisfortran
    Roll array elements along a given axis.

    Elements that roll beyond the last position are re-introduced at
    the first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    shift : int or tuple of ints
        The number of places by which elements are shifted.  If a tuple,
        then `axis` must be a tuple of the same size, and each of the
        given axes is shifted by the corresponding number.  If an int
        while `axis` is a tuple of ints, then the same value is used for
        all given axes.
    axis : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which elements are shifted.  By default, the
        array is flattened before shifting, after which the original
        shape is restored.

    Returns
    -------
    res : ndarray
        Output array, with the same shape as `a`.

    Cross-correlation of two 1-dimensional sequences.

    This function computes the correlation as generally defined in signal
    processing texts::

        c_{av}[k] = sum_n a[n+k] * conj(v[n])

    with a and v sequences being zero-padded where necessary and conj being
    the conjugate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, v : array_like
        Input sequences.
    mode : {'valid', 'same', 'full'}, optional
        Refer to the `convolve` docstring.  Note that the default
        is 'valid', unlike `convolve`, which uses 'full'.
    old_behavior : bool
        `old_behavior` was removed in NumPy 1.10. If you need the old
        behavior, use `multiarray.correlate`.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Discrete cross-correlation of `a` and `v`.

    See Also
    --------
    convolve : Discrete, linear convolution of two one-dimensional sequences.
    multiarray.correlate : Old, no conjugate, version of correlate.

    Notes
    -----
    The definition of correlation above is not unique and sometimes correlation
    may be defined differently. Another common definition is::

        c'_{av}[k] = sum_n a[n] conj(v[n+k])

    which is related to ``c_{av}[k]`` by ``c'_{av}[k] = c_{av}[-k]``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.correlate([1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 0.5])
    array([ 3.5])
    >>> np.correlate([1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 0.5], "same")
    array([ 2. ,  3.5,  3. ])
    >>> np.correlate([1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 0.5], "full")
    array([ 0.5,  2. ,  3.5,  3. ,  0. ])

    Using complex sequences:

    >>> np.correlate([1+1j, 2, 3-1j], [0, 1, 0.5j], 'full')
    array([ 0.5-0.5j,  1.0+0.j ,  1.5-1.5j,  3.0-1.j ,  0.0+0.j ])

    Note that you get the time reversed, complex conjugated result
    when the two input sequences change places, i.e.,
    ``c_{va}[k] = c^{*}_{av}[-k]``:

    >>> np.correlate([0, 1, 0.5j], [1+1j, 2, 3-1j], 'full')
    array([ 0.0+0.j ,  3.0+1.j ,  1.5+1.5j,  1.0+0.j ,  0.5+0.5j])

    
    Set the size of the buffer used in ufuncs.

    >>> np.moveaxis(x, -1, 0).shape
    (5, 3, 4)

    These all achieve the same result:

    >>> np.transpose(x).shape
    (5, 4, 3)
    >>> np.swapaxes(x, 0, -1).shape
    (5, 4, 3)

    Insufficient bit width provided. This behavior will raise an error in the future.
    Set how floating-point errors are handled.

    Note that operations on integer scalar types (such as `int16`) are
    handled like floating point, and are affected by these settings.

    Parameters
    ----------
    all : {'ignore', 'warn', 'raise', 'call', 'print', 'log'}, optional
        Set treatment for all types of floating-point errors at once:

        - ignore: Take no action when the exception occurs.
        - warn: Print a `RuntimeWarning` (via the Python `warnings` module).
        - raise: Raise a `FloatingPointError`.
        - call: Call a function specified using the `seterrcall` function.
        - print: Print a warning directly to ``stdout``.
        - log: Record error in a Log object specified by `seterrcall`.

        The default is not to change the current behavior.
    divide : {'ignore', 'warn', 'raise', 'call', 'print', 'log'}, optional
        Treatment for division by zero.
    over : {'ignore', 'warn', 'raise', 'call', 'print', 'log'}, optional
        Treatment for floating-point overflow.
    under : {'ignore', 'warn', 'raise', 'call', 'print', 'log'}, optional
        Treatment for floating-point underflow.
    invalid : {'ignore', 'warn', 'raise', 'call', 'print', 'log'}, optional
        Treatment for invalid floating-point operation.

    Returns
    -------
    old_settings : dict
        Dictionary containing the old settings.

    --------
    seterrcall : Set a callback function for the 'call' mode.
    geterr, geterrcall, errstate

    Notes
    -----
    The floating-point exceptions are defined in the IEEE 754 standard [1]_:

    - Division by zero: infinite result obtained from finite numbers.
    - Overflow: result too large to be expressed.
    - Underflow: result so close to zero that some precision
      was lost.
    - Invalid operation: result is not an expressible number, typically
      indicates that a NaN was produced.

    Find the indices of array elements that are non-zero, grouped by element.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.

    Returns
    -------
    index_array : ndarray
        Indices of elements that are non-zero. Indices are grouped by element.

    Notes
    -----
    ``np.argwhere(a)`` is the same as ``np.transpose(np.nonzero(a))``.

    The output of ``argwhere`` is not suitable for indexing arrays.
    For this purpose use ``nonzero(a)`` instead.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(6).reshape(2,3)
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5]])
    >>> np.argwhere(x>1)

           [1, 0],
           [1, 1],
           [1, 2]])

    Convert the input to an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data, in any form that can be converted to an array.  This
        includes lists, lists of tuples, tuples, tuples of tuples, tuples
        of lists and ndarrays.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        By default, the data-type is inferred from the input data.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
        Whether to use row-major (C-style) or
        column-major (Fortran-style) memory representation.
        Defaults to 'C'.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array interpretation of `a`.  No copy is performed if the input
        is already an ndarray with matching dtype and order.  If `a` is a
        subclass of ndarray, a base class ndarray is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    asanyarray : Similar function which passes through subclasses.
    ascontiguousarray : Convert input to a contiguous array.
    asfarray : Convert input to a floating point ndarray.
    asfortranarray : Convert input to an ndarray with column-major
                     memory order.
    asarray_chkfinite : Similar function which checks input for NaNs and Infs.
    fromiter : Create an array from an iterator.
    fromfunction : Construct an array by executing a function on grid
                   positions.

    Examples
    --------
    Convert a list into an array:

    >>> a = [1, 2]
    >>> np.asarray(a)
    array([1, 2])

    Existing arrays are not copied:

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2])
    >>> np.asarray(a) is a
    True

    If `dtype` is set, array is copied only if dtype does not match:

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2], dtype=np.float32)
    >>> np.asarray(a, dtype=np.float32) is a
    True
    >>> np.asarray(a, dtype=np.float64) is a
    False

    Contrary to `asanyarray`, ndarray subclasses are not passed through:

    >>> issubclass(np.recarray, np.ndarray)
    True
    >>> a = np.array([(1.0, 2), (3.0, 4)], dtype='f4,i4').view(np.recarray)

    Compute tensor dot product along specified axes for arrays >= 1-D.

    Given two tensors (arrays of dimension greater than or equal to one),
    `a` and `b`, and an array_like object containing two array_like
    objects, ``(a_axes, b_axes)``, sum the products of `a`'s and `b`'s
    elements (components) over the axes specified by ``a_axes`` and
    ``b_axes``. The third argument can be a single non-negative
    integer_like scalar, ``N``; if it is such, then the last ``N``
    dimensions of `a` and the first ``N`` dimensions of `b` are summed
    over.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : array_like, len(shape) >= 1
        Tensors to "dot".

    axes : int or (2,) array_like
        * integer_like
          If an int N, sum over the last N axes of `a` and the first N axes
          of `b` in order. The sizes of the corresponding axes must match.
        * (2,) array_like
          Or, a list of axes to be summed over, first sequence applying to `a`,
          second to `b`. Both elements array_like must be of the same length.

    See Also
    --------
    dot, einsum

    Notes
    -----
    Three common use cases are:
        * ``axes = 0`` : tensor product :math:`a\otimes b`
        * ``axes = 1`` : tensor dot product :math:`a\cdot b`
        * ``axes = 2`` : (default) tensor double contraction :math:`a:b`

    When `axes` is integer_like, the sequence for evaluation will be: first
    the -Nth axis in `a` and 0th axis in `b`, and the -1th axis in `a` and
    Nth axis in `b` last.

    When there is more than one axis to sum over - and they are not the last
    (first) axes of `a` (`b`) - the argument `axes` should consist of
    two sequences of the same length, with the first axis to sum over given
    first in both sequences, the second axis second, and so forth.

    Examples
    --------
    A "traditional" example:

    >>> a = np.arange(60.).reshape(3,4,5)
    >>> b = np.arange(24.).reshape(4,3,2)
    >>> c = np.tensordot(a,b, axes=([1,0],[0,1]))
    >>> c.shape
    (5, 2)
    >>> c
    array([[ 4400.,  4730.],
           [ 4532.,  4874.],
           [ 4664.,  5018.],
           [ 4796.,  5162.],
           [ 4928.,  5306.]])
    >>> # A slower but equivalent way of computing the same...
    >>> d = np.zeros((5,2))
    >>> for i in range(5):
    ...   for j in range(2):
    ...     for k in range(3):
    ...       for n in range(4):
    ...         d[i,j] += a[k,n,i] * b[n,k,j]
    >>> c == d
    array([[ True,  True],
           [ True,  True],
           [ True,  True],
           [ True,  True],
           [ True,  True]])

    An extended example taking advantage of the overloading of + and \*:

    >>> a = np.array(range(1, 9))
    >>> a.shape = (2, 2, 2)
    >>> A = np.array(('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'), dtype=object)
    >>> A.shape = (2, 2)
    >>> a; A

    array([acccbbdddd, aaaaacccccccbbbbbbdddddddd], dtype=object)

    Return an ndarray of the provided type that satisfies requirements.

    This function is useful to be sure that an array with the correct flags
    is returned for passing to compiled code (perhaps through ctypes).

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
       The object to be converted to a type-and-requirement-satisfying array.
    dtype : data-type
       The required data-type. If None preserve the current dtype. If your
       application requires the data to be in native byteorder, include
       a byteorder specification as a part of the dtype specification.
    requirements : str or list of str
       The requirements list can be any of the following

       * 'F_CONTIGUOUS' ('F') - ensure a Fortran-contiguous array
       * 'C_CONTIGUOUS' ('C') - ensure a C-contiguous array
       * 'ALIGNED' ('A')      - ensure a data-type aligned array
       * 'WRITEABLE' ('W')    - ensure a writable array
       * 'OWNDATA' ('O')      - ensure an array that owns its own data
       * 'ENSUREARRAY', ('E') - ensure a base array, instead of a subclass

    Return an array (ndim >= 1) laid out in Fortran order in memory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    dtype : str or dtype object, optional
        By default, the data-type is inferred from the input data.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The input `a` in Fortran, or column-major, order.

    See Also
    --------
    ascontiguousarray : Convert input to a contiguous (C order) array.
    asanyarray : Convert input to an ndarray with either row or

    >>> x.flags['F_CONTIGUOUS']
    False
    >>> y.flags['F_CONTIGUOUS']
    True

    Note: This function returns an array with at least one-dimension (1-d) 
    so it will not preserve 0-d arrays.  

    
    Return the binary representation of the input number as a string.

    For negative numbers, if width is not given, a minus sign is added to the
    front. If width is given, the two's complement of the number is
    returned, with respect to that width.

    In a two's-complement system negative numbers are represented by the two's
    complement of the absolute value. This is the most common method of
    representing signed integers on computers [1]_. A N-bit two's-complement
    system can represent every integer in the range
    :math:`-2^{N-1}` to :math:`+2^{N-1}-1`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num : int
        Only an integer decimal number can be used.
    width : int, optional
        The length of the returned string if `num` is positive, or the length
        of the two's complement if `num` is negative, provided that `width` is
        at least a sufficient number of bits for `num` to be represented in the
        designated form.

        If the `width` value is insufficient, it will be ignored, and `num` will
        be returned in binary (`num` > 0) or two's complement (`num` < 0) form
        with its width equal to the minimum number of bits needed to represent
        the number in the designated form. This behavior is deprecated and will
        later raise an error.

        .. deprecated:: 1.12.0

    Returns
    -------
    bin : str
        Binary representation of `num` or two's complement of `num`.

    See Also
    --------
    base_repr: Return a string representation of a number in the given base
               system.
    bin: Python's built-in binary representation generator of an integer.

    Notes
    -----
    `binary_repr` is equivalent to using `base_repr` with base 2, but about 25x
    faster.

    width is specified:

    >>> np.binary_repr(-3, width=3)
    '101'
    >>> np.binary_repr(-3, width=5)

    Get the current way of handling floating-point errors.

    Returns
    -------
    res : dict
        A dictionary with keys "divide", "over", "under", and "invalid",
        whose values are from the strings "ignore", "print", "log", "warn",
        "raise", and "call". The keys represent possible floating-point
        exceptions, and the values define how these exceptions are handled.

    See Also
    --------
    geterrcall, seterr, seterrcall

    Notes
    -----
    For complete documentation of the types of floating-point exceptions and
    treatment options, see `seterr`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.geterr()
    {'over': 'warn', 'divide': 'warn', 'invalid': 'warn',
    'under': 'ignore'}
    >>> np.arange(3.) / np.arange(3.)
    array([ NaN,   1.,   1.])

    >>> oldsettings = np.seterr(all='warn', over='raise')
    >>> np.geterr()
    {'over': 'raise', 'divide': 'warn', 'invalid': 'warn', 'under': 'warn'}
    >>> np.arange(3.) / np.arange(3.)
    __main__:1: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide
    array([ NaN,   1.,   1.])

    
    Set the floating-point error callback function or log object.

    There are two ways to capture floating-point error messages.  The first
    is to set the error-handler to 'call', using `seterr`.  Then, set
    the function to call using this function.

    The second is to set the error-handler to 'log', using `seterr`.
    Floating-point errors then trigger a call to the 'write' method of
    the provided object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable f(err, flag) or object with write method
        Function to call upon floating-point errors ('call'-mode) or
        object whose 'write' method is used to log such message ('log'-mode).

        The call function takes two arguments. The first is a string describing
        the type of error (such as "divide by zero", "overflow", "underflow",
        or "invalid value"), and the second is the status flag.  The flag is a
        byte, whose four least-significant bits indicate the type of error, one
        of "divide", "over", "under", "invalid"::

          [0 0 0 0 divide over under invalid]

        In other words, ``flags = divide + 2*over + 4*under + 8*invalid``.

        If an object is provided, its write method should take one argument,
        a string.

    Returns
    -------
    h : callable, log instance or None
        The old error handler.

    See Also
    --------
    seterr, geterr, geterrcall

    Examples
    --------
    Callback upon error:

    >>> def err_handler(type, flag):
    ...     print("Floating point error (%s), with flag %s" % (type, flag))
    ...

    >>> saved_handler = np.seterrcall(err_handler)
    >>> save_err = np.seterr(all='call')

    >>> np.array([1, 2, 3]) / 0.0
    Floating point error (divide by zero), with flag 1
    array([ Inf,  Inf,  Inf])

    >>> np.seterrcall(saved_handler)
    <function err_handler at 0x...>
    >>> np.seterr(**save_err)
    {'over': 'call', 'divide': 'call', 'invalid': 'call', 'under': 'call'}

    Log error message:

    >>> class Log(object):
    ...     def write(self, msg):
    ...         print("LOG: %s" % msg)
    ...

    >>> log = Log()
    >>> saved_handler = np.seterrcall(log)
    >>> save_err = np.seterr(all='log')

    Returns True if the array is Fortran contiguous but *not* C contiguous.

    This function is obsolete and, because of changes due to relaxed stride
    checking, its return value for the same array may differ for versions
    of NumPy >= 1.10.0 and previous versions. If you only want to check if an
    array is Fortran contiguous use ``a.flags.f_contiguous`` instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input array.


    Examples
    --------

    np.array allows to specify whether the array is written in C-contiguous
    order (last index varies the fastest), or FORTRAN-contiguous order in
    memory (first index varies the fastest).

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], order='C')
    >>> a
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> np.isfortran(a)
    False

    >>> b = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], order='FORTRAN')
    >>> b
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> np.isfortran(b)
    True


    The transpose of a C-ordered array is a FORTRAN-ordered array.

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], order='C')
    >>> a
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> np.isfortran(a)
    False
    >>> b = a.T
    >>> b
    array([[1, 4],
           [2, 5],
           [3, 6]])
    >>> np.isfortran(b)
    True

    C-ordered arrays evaluate as False even if they are also FORTRAN-ordered.

    >>> np.isfortran(np.array([1, 2], order='FORTRAN'))
    False

    
    Return the size of the buffer used in ufuncs.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.full((2, 2), np.inf)
    array([[ inf,  inf],
           [ inf,  inf]])
    >>> np.full((2, 2), 10)
    array([[10, 10],
           [10, 10]])

    Return a new array of given shape and type, filled with ones.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : int or sequence of ints
        Shape of the new array, e.g., ``(2, 3)`` or ``2``.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The desired data-type for the array, e.g., `numpy.int8`.  Default is
        `numpy.float64`.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional, default: C
        Whether to store multi-dimensional data in row-major
        (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) order in
        memory.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of ones with the given shape, dtype, and order.

    empty : Return a new uninitialized array.
    zeros : Return a new array setting values to zero.
    full : Return a new array of given shape filled with value.


    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.ones(5)
    array([ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])

    >>> np.ones((5,), dtype=int)
    array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])

    >>> np.ones((2, 1))
    array([[ 1.],
           [ 1.]])

    >>> s = (2,2)
    >>> np.ones(s)
    array([[ 1.,  1.],
           [ 1.,  1.]])

    
    Returns a boolean array where two arrays are element-wise equal within a
    tolerance.

    The tolerance values are positive, typically very small numbers.  The
    relative difference (`rtol` * abs(`b`)) and the absolute difference
    `atol` are added together to compare against the absolute difference
    between `a` and `b`.

    .. warning:: The default `atol` is not appropriate for comparing numbers
                 that are much smaller than one (see Notes).

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : array_like
        Input arrays to compare.
    rtol : float
        The relative tolerance parameter (see Notes).
    atol : float
        The absolute tolerance parameter (see Notes).
    equal_nan : bool
        Whether to compare NaN's as equal.  If True, NaN's in `a` will be
        considered equal to NaN's in `b` in the output array.

    Returns
    -------
    y : array_like
        Returns a boolean array of where `a` and `b` are equal within the
        given tolerance. If both `a` and `b` are scalars, returns a single
        boolean value.

    allclose

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    For finite values, isclose uses the following equation to test whether
    two floating point values are equivalent.

     absolute(`a` - `b`) <= (`atol` + `rtol` * absolute(`b`))

    Unlike the built-in `math.isclose`, the above equation is not symmetric
    in `a` and `b` -- it assumes `b` is the reference value -- so that
    `isclose(a, b)` might be different from `isclose(b, a)`. Furthermore,
    the default value of atol is not zero, and is used to determine what
    small values should be considered close to zero. The default value is
    appropriate for expected values of order unity: if the expected values
    are significantly smaller than one, it can result in false positives.
    `atol` should be carefully selected for the use case at hand. A zero value
    for `atol` will result in `False` if either `a` or `b` is zero.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.isclose([1e10,1e-7], [1.00001e10,1e-8])
    array([True, False])
    >>> np.isclose([1e10,1e-8], [1.00001e10,1e-9])
    array([True, True])
    >>> np.isclose([1e10,1e-8], [1.0001e10,1e-9])
    array([False, True])
    >>> np.isclose([1.0, np.nan], [1.0, np.nan])
    array([True, False])
    >>> np.isclose([1.0, np.nan], [1.0, np.nan], equal_nan=True)
    array([True, True])
    >>> np.isclose([1e-8, 1e-7], [0.0, 0.0])
    array([ True, False], dtype=bool)
    >>> np.isclose([1e-100, 1e-7], [0.0, 0.0], atol=0.0)
    array([False, False], dtype=bool)
    >>> np.isclose([1e-10, 1e-10], [1e-20, 0.0])
    array([ True,  True], dtype=bool)
    >>> np.isclose([1e-10, 1e-10], [1e-20, 0.999999e-10], atol=0.0)
    array([False,  True], dtype=bool)
    _cross_dispatcher_unspecified
    Return an array of ones with the same shape and type as a given array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The shape and data-type of `a` define these same attributes of
        the returned array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Overrides the data type of the result.

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A', or 'K'}, optional
        Overrides the memory layout of the result. 'C' means C-order,
        'F' means F-order, 'A' means 'F' if `a` is Fortran contiguous,
        'C' otherwise. 'K' means match the layout of `a` as closely
        as possible.

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0
    subok : bool, optional.
        If True, then the newly created array will use the sub-class
        type of 'a', otherwise it will be a base-class array. Defaults
        to True.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of ones with the same shape and type as `a`.

    See Also
    --------
    empty_like : Return an empty array with shape and type of input.
    zeros_like : Return an array of zeros with shape and type of input.
    full_like : Return a new array with shape of input filled with value.
    ones : Return a new array setting values to one.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(6)
    >>> x = x.reshape((2, 3))
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5]])
    >>> np.ones_like(x)
    array([[1, 1, 1],
           [1, 1, 1]])

    >>> y = np.arange(3, dtype=float)
    >>> y
    array([ 0.,  1.,  2.])
    >>> np.ones_like(y)
    array([ 1.,  1.,  1.])

    
    Returns True if two arrays are element-wise equal within a tolerance.

    The tolerance values are positive, typically very small numbers.  The
    relative difference (`rtol` * abs(`b`)) and the absolute difference
    `atol` are added together to compare against the absolute difference
    between `a` and `b`.

    If either array contains one or more NaNs, False is returned.
    Infs are treated as equal if they are in the same place and of the same
    sign in both arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : array_like
        Input arrays to compare.
    rtol : float
        The relative tolerance parameter (see Notes).
    atol : float
        The absolute tolerance parameter (see Notes).
    equal_nan : bool
        Whether to compare NaN's as equal.  If True, NaN's in `a` will be
        considered equal to NaN's in `b` in the output array.

        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    Returns
    -------
    allclose : bool
        Returns True if the two arrays are equal within the given
        tolerance; False otherwise.

    See Also
    --------
    isclose, all, any, equal

    Notes
    -----
    If the following equation is element-wise True, then allclose returns
    True.

     absolute(`a` - `b`) <= (`atol` + `rtol` * absolute(`b`))

    The above equation is not symmetric in `a` and `b`, so that
    ``allclose(a, b)`` might be different from ``allclose(b, a)`` in
    some rare cases.

    The comparison of `a` and `b` uses standard broadcasting, which
    means that `a` and `b` need not have the same shape in order for
    ``allclose(a, b)`` to evaluate to True.  The same is true for
    `equal` but not `array_equal`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.allclose([1e10,1e-7], [1.00001e10,1e-8])
    False
    >>> np.allclose([1e10,1e-8], [1.00001e10,1e-9])
    True
    >>> np.allclose([1e10,1e-8], [1.0001e10,1e-9])
    False
    >>> np.allclose([1.0, np.nan], [1.0, np.nan])
    False
    >>> np.allclose([1.0, np.nan], [1.0, np.nan], equal_nan=True)
    True

    
    errstate(**kwargs)

    Context manager for floating-point error handling.

    Using an instance of `errstate` as a context manager allows statements in
    that context to execute with a known error handling behavior. Upon entering
    the context the error handling is set with `seterr` and `seterrcall`, and
    upon exiting it is reset to what it was before.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kwargs : {divide, over, under, invalid}
        Keyword arguments. The valid keywords are the possible floating-point
        exceptions. Each keyword should have a string value that defines the
        treatment for the particular error. Possible values are
        {'ignore', 'warn', 'raise', 'call', 'print', 'log'}.

    See Also
    --------
    seterr, geterr, seterrcall, geterrcall

    Notes
    -----
    For complete documentation of the types of floating-point exceptions and
    treatment options, see `seterr`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> olderr = np.seterr(all='ignore')  # Set error handling to known state.

    >>> np.arange(3) / 0.
    array([ NaN,  Inf,  Inf])
    >>> with np.errstate(divide='warn'):
    ...     np.arange(3) / 0.
    ...
    __main__:2: RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in divide
    array([ NaN,  Inf,  Inf])

    >>> np.sqrt(-1)
    nan
    >>> with np.errstate(invalid='raise'):
    ...     np.sqrt(-1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
    FloatingPointError: invalid value encountered in sqrt

    Outside the context the error handling behavior has not changed:

    >>> np.geterr()
    {'over': 'warn', 'divide': 'warn', 'invalid': 'warn',
    'under': 'ignore'}

    v cannot be empty
    Returns True if the type of `num` is a scalar type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num : any
        Input argument, can be of any type and shape.

    Returns
    -------
    val : bool
        True if `num` is a scalar type, False if it is not.

    Notes

    In almost all cases ``np.ndim(x) == 0`` should be used instead of this

    and the ``bins`` argument to `histogram`. Some key differences:

    np.core.numeric.loads is deprecated, use pickle.loads instead
    Normalizes an axis argument into a tuple of non-negative integer axes.

    This handles shorthands such as ``1`` and converts them to ``(1,)``,
    as well as performing the handling of negative indices covered by
    `normalize_axis_index`.

    By default, this forbids axes from being specified multiple times.

    Used internally by multi-axis-checking logic.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    axis : int, iterable of int
        The un-normalized index or indices of the axis.
    ndim : int
        The number of dimensions of the array that `axis` should be normalized
        against.
    argname : str, optional
        A prefix to put before the error message, typically the name of the
        argument.
    allow_duplicate : bool, optional
        If False, the default, disallow an axis from being specified twice.

    Returns
    -------
    normalized_axes : tuple of int
        The normalized axis index, such that `0 <= normalized_axis < ndim`

    Raises
    ------
    AxisError
        If any axis provided is out of range
    ValueError
        If an axis is repeated

    See also
    --------
    normalize_axis_index : normalizing a single scalar axis
    
    Return an array representing the indices of a grid.

    Compute an array where the subarrays contain index values 0,1,...
    varying only along the corresponding axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dimensions : sequence of ints
        The shape of the grid.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Data type of the result.

    Returns
    -------
    grid : ndarray
        The array of grid indices,
        ``grid.shape = (len(dimensions),) + tuple(dimensions)``.

    See Also
    --------
    mgrid, meshgrid

    Notes
    -----
    The output shape is obtained by prepending the number of dimensions
    in front of the tuple of dimensions, i.e. if `dimensions` is a tuple
    ``(r0, ..., rN-1)`` of length ``N``, the output shape is
    ``(N,r0,...,rN-1)``.

    The subarrays ``grid[k]`` contains the N-D array of indices along the
    ``k-th`` axis. Explicitly::

        grid[k,i0,i1,...,iN-1] = ik

    Examples
    --------
    >>> grid = np.indices((2, 3))
    >>> grid.shape
    (2, 2, 3)
    >>> grid[0]        # row indices
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [1, 1, 1]])
    >>> grid[1]        # column indices
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [0, 1, 2]])

    The indices can be used as an index into an array.

    >>> x = np.arange(20).reshape(5, 4)
    >>> row, col = np.indices((2, 3))
    >>> x[row, col]
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [4, 5, 6]])

    Note that it would be more straightforward in the above example to
    extract the required elements directly with ``x[:2, :3]``.

        ÐcA_convolve_dispatcher
    Roll the specified axis backwards, until it lies in a given position.

    This function continues to be supported for backward compatibility, but you
    should prefer `moveaxis`. The `moveaxis` function was added in NumPy
    1.11.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input array.
    axis : int
        The axis to roll backwards.  The positions of the other axes do not
        change relative to one another.
    start : int, optional
        The axis is rolled until it lies before this position.  The default,
        0, results in a "complete" roll.

    Returns
    -------
    res : ndarray
        For NumPy >= 1.10.0 a view of `a` is always returned. For earlier
        NumPy versions a view of `a` is returned only if the order of the
        axes is changed, otherwise the input array is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    moveaxis : Move array axes to new positions.
    roll : Roll the elements of an array by a number of positions along a
        given axis.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.ones((3,4,5,6))
    >>> np.rollaxis(a, 3, 1).shape
    (3, 6, 4, 5)
    >>> np.rollaxis(a, 2).shape
    (5, 3, 4, 6)
    >>> np.rollaxis(a, 1, 4).shape
    (3, 5, 6, 4)

    
    Construct an array by executing a function over each coordinate.

    The resulting array therefore has a value ``fn(x, y, z)`` at
    coordinate ``(x, y, z)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    function : callable
        The function is called with N parameters, where N is the rank of
        `shape`.  Each parameter represents the coordinates of the array
        varying along a specific axis.  For example, if `shape`
        were ``(2, 2)``, then the parameters would be
        ``array([[0, 0], [1, 1]])`` and ``array([[0, 1], [0, 1]])``
    shape : (N,) tuple of ints
        Shape of the output array, which also determines the shape of
        the coordinate arrays passed to `function`.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Data-type of the coordinate arrays passed to `function`.
        By default, `dtype` is float.

    Returns
    -------
    fromfunction : any
        The result of the call to `function` is passed back directly.
        Therefore the shape of `fromfunction` is completely determined by
        `function`.  If `function` returns a scalar value, the shape of
        `fromfunction` would not match the `shape` parameter.

    See Also
    --------
    indices, meshgrid

    Notes
    -----
    Keywords other than `dtype` are passed to `function`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.fromfunction(lambda i, j: i == j, (3, 3), dtype=int)
    array([[ True, False, False],
           [False,  True, False],
           [False, False,  True]])

    >>> np.fromfunction(lambda i, j: i + j, (3, 3), dtype=int)
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [1, 2, 3],
           [2, 3, 4]])

    _ones_like_dispatcherBuffer size, %s, is too big.SHIFT_INVALID
    True if two arrays have the same shape and elements, False otherwise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a1, a2 : array_like
        Input arrays.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        Returns True if the arrays are equal.

    See Also
    --------
    allclose: Returns True if two arrays are element-wise equal within a
              tolerance.
    array_equiv: Returns True if input arrays are shape consistent and all
                 elements equal.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.array_equal([1, 2], [1, 2])
    True
    >>> np.array_equal(np.array([1, 2]), np.array([1, 2]))
    True
    >>> np.array_equal([1, 2], [1, 2, 3])
    False
    >>> np.array_equal([1, 2], [1, 4])
    False

    _array_equiv_dispatcher
    The warning raised when casting a complex dtype to a real dtype.

    As implemented, casting a complex number to a real discards its imaginary
    part, but this behavior may not be what the user actually wants.

    
    Return the current callback function used on floating-point errors.

    When the error handling for a floating-point error (one of "divide",
    "over", "under", or "invalid") is set to 'call' or 'log', the function
    that is called or the log instance that is written to is returned by
    `geterrcall`. This function or log instance has been set with
    `seterrcall`.

    Returns
    -------
    errobj : callable, log instance or None
        The current error handler. If no handler was set through `seterrcall`,
        ``None`` is returned.

    >>> np.geterrcall()  # we did not yet set a handler, returns None

    >>> oldsettings = np.seterr(all='call')
    >>> def err_handler(type, flag):
    ...     print("Floating point error (%s), with flag %s" % (type, flag))
    >>> oldhandler = np.seterrcall(err_handler)
    >>> np.array([1, 2, 3]) / 0.0
    Floating point error (divide by zero), with flag 1

    >>> cur_handler = np.geterrcall()
    >>> cur_handler is err_handler
    True

    _errdict_revisclose.<locals>.within_tol
    Return indices that are non-zero in the flattened version of a.

    This is equivalent to np.nonzero(np.ravel(a))[0].

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.

    Returns
    -------
    res : ndarray
        Output array, containing the indices of the elements of `a.ravel()`
        that are non-zero.

    See Also
    --------
    nonzero : Return the indices of the non-zero elements of the input array.
    ravel : Return a 1-D array containing the elements of the input array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(-2, 3)
    >>> x
    array([-2, -1,  0,  1,  2])
    >>> np.flatnonzero(x)
    array([0, 1, 3, 4])

    Use the indices of the non-zero elements as an index array to extract
    these elements:

    >>> x.ravel()[np.flatnonzero(x)]
    array([-2, -1,  1,  2])

    Examples

    Return the string representation of a scalar dtype.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sctype : scalar dtype or object
        If a scalar dtype, the corresponding string character is
        returned. If an object, `sctype2char` tries to infer its scalar type
        and then return the corresponding string character.

    Returns
    -------
    typechar : str
        The string character corresponding to the scalar type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `sctype` is an object for which the type can not be inferred.

    genericTypeRankmaxsc<module numpy.core.numerictypes>_register_typesmaxamaximum_sctypeUnicodeType
    Determine common type following standard coercion rules.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array_types : sequence
        A list of dtypes or dtype convertible objects representing arrays.
    scalar_types : sequence
        A list of dtypes or dtype convertible objects representing scalars.

    Returns
    -------
    datatype : dtype
        The common data type, which is the maximum of `array_types` ignoring
        `scalar_types`, unless the maximum of `scalar_types` is of a
        different kind (`dtype.kind`). If the kind is not understood, then
        None is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    dtype, common_type, can_cast, mintypecode

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.find_common_type([], [np.int64, np.float32, complex])
    dtype('complex128')
    >>> np.find_common_type([np.int64, np.float32], [])
    dtype('float64')

    The standard casting rules ensure that a scalar cannot up-cast an
    array unless the scalar is of a fundamentally different kind of data
    (i.e. under a different hierarchy in the data type hierarchy) then
    the array:

    >>> np.find_common_type([np.float32], [np.int64, np.float64])
    dtype('float32')

    Complex is of a different type, so it up-casts the float in the
    `array_types` argument:

    >>> np.find_common_type([np.float32], [complex])
    dtype('complex128')

    Type specifier strings are convertible to dtypes and can therefore
    be used instead of dtypes:

    >>> np.find_common_type(['f4', 'f4', 'i4'], ['c8'])
    dtype('complex128')

    arg2_origmro
    Determine if a class is a subclass of a second class.

    `issubclass_` is equivalent to the Python built-in ``issubclass``,
    except that it returns False instead of raising a TypeError if one
    of the arguments is not a class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arg1 : class
        Input class. True is returned if `arg1` is a subclass of `arg2`.
    arg2 : class or tuple of classes.
        Input class. If a tuple of classes, True is returned if `arg1` is a
        subclass of any of the tuple elements.

    Returns
    -------
    out : bool
        Whether `arg1` is a subclass of `arg2` or not.

    See Also
    --------
    issubsctype, issubdtype, issctype

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.issubclass_(np.int32, int)
    True
    >>> np.issubclass_(np.int32, float)
    False

    dtypelist
    Base object for a dictionary for look-up with any alias for an array dtype.

    Instances of `_typedict` can not be used as dictionaries directly,
    first they have to be populated.

    issubdtype.<locals>.type_repr_construct_lookups
    Return the scalar dtype or NumPy equivalent of Python type of an object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rep : any
        The object of which the type is returned.
    default : any, optional
        If given, this is returned for objects whose types can not be
        determined. If not given, None is returned for those objects.

    Returns
    -------
    dtype : dtype or Python type
        The data type of `rep`.

    See NEP-18 for example usage.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dispatcher : callable
        Function that when called like ``dispatcher(*args, **kwargs)`` with
        arguments from the NumPy function call returns an iterable of
        array-like arguments to check for ``__array_function__``.

        By default, module is copied from the decorated function.
    verify : bool, optional
        If True, verify the that the signature of the dispatcher and decorated
        function signatures match exactly: all required and optional arguments
        should appear in order with the same names, but the default values for
        all optional arguments should be ``None``. Only disable verification

Record Arrays
=============
Record arrays expose the fields of structured arrays as properties.

Most commonly, ndarrays contain elements of a single type, e.g. floats,
integers, bools etc.  However, it is possible for elements to be combinations
of these using structured types, such as::

  >>> a = np.array([(1, 2.0), (1, 2.0)], dtype=[('x', int), ('y', float)])
  >>> a
  array([(1, 2.0), (1, 2.0)],
        dtype=[('x', '<i4'), ('y', '<f8')])

Here, each element consists of two fields: x (and int), and y (a float).
This is known as a structured array.  The different fields are analogous
to columns in a spread-sheet.  The different fields can be accessed as
one would a dictionary::

  >>> a['x']
  array([1, 1])

  >>> a['y']
  array([ 2.,  2.])

Record arrays allow us to access fields as properties::

  >>> ar = np.rec.array(a)

  >>> ar.x
  array([1, 1])

  >>> ar.y
  array([ 2.,  2.])

    Class to convert formats, names, titles description to a dtype.

    After constructing the format_parser object, the dtype attribute is
    the converted data-type:
    ``dtype = format_parser(formats, names, titles).dtype``

    Attributes
    ----------
    dtype : dtype
        The converted data-type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    formats : str or list of str
        The format description, either specified as a string with
        comma-separated format descriptions in the form ``'f8, i4, a5'``, or
        a list of format description strings  in the form
        ``['f8', 'i4', 'a5']``.
    names : str or list/tuple of str
        The field names, either specified as a comma-separated string in the
        form ``'col1, col2, col3'``, or as a list or tuple of strings in the
        form ``['col1', 'col2', 'col3']``.
        An empty list can be used, in that case default field names
        ('f0', 'f1', ...) are used.
    titles : sequence
        Sequence of title strings. An empty list can be used to leave titles
        out.
    aligned : bool, optional
        If True, align the fields by padding as the C-compiler would.
        Default is False.
    byteorder : str, optional
        If specified, all the fields will be changed to the
        provided byte-order.  Otherwise, the default byte-order is
        used. For all available string specifiers, see `dtype.newbyteorder`.

    See Also
    --------
    dtype, typename, sctype2char

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.format_parser(['f8', 'i4', 'a5'], ['col1', 'col2', 'col3'],
    ...                  ['T1', 'T2', 'T3']).dtype
    dtype([(('T1', 'col1'), '<f8'), (('T2', 'col2'), '<i4'),
           (('T3', 'col3'), '|S5')])

    `names` and/or `titles` can be empty lists. If `titles` is an empty list,
    titles will simply not appear. If `names` is empty, default field names
    will be used.

    >>> np.format_parser(['f8', 'i4', 'a5'], ['col1', 'col2', 'col3'],
    ...                  []).dtype
    dtype([('col1', '<f8'), ('col2', '<i4'), ('col3', '|S5')])
    >>> np.format_parser(['f8', 'i4', 'a5'], [], []).dtype
    dtype([('f0', '<f8'), ('f1', '<i4'), ('f2', '|S5')])

    Duplicate field names: %snbytesread create a recarray from a list of records in text form

        The data in the same field can be heterogeneous, they will be promoted
        to the highest data type.  This method is intended for creating
        smaller record arrays.  If used to create large array without formats
        defined

    Arrays may have a data-types containing fields, analogous
    to columns in a spread sheet.  An example is ``[(x, int), (y, float)]``,
    where each entry in the array is a pair of ``(int, float)``.  Normally,
    these attributes are accessed using dictionary lookups such as ``arr['x']``
    and ``arr['y']``.  Record arrays allow the fields to be accessed as members
    of the array, using ``arr.x`` and ``arr.y``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : tuple
        Shape of output array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The desired data-type.  By default, the data-type is determined
        from `formats`, `names`, `titles`, `aligned` and `byteorder`.
    formats : list of data-types, optional
        A list containing the data-types for the different columns, e.g.
        ``['i4', 'f8', 'i4']``.  `formats` does *not* support the new
        convention of using types directly, i.e. ``(int, float, int)``.
        Note that `formats` must be a list, not a tuple.
        Given that `formats` is somewhat limited, we recommend specifying
        `dtype` instead.
    names : tuple of str, optional
        The name of each column, e.g. ``('x', 'y', 'z')``.
    buf : buffer, optional
        By default, a new array is created of the given shape and data-type.
        If `buf` is specified and is an object exposing the buffer interface,
        the array will use the memory from the existing buffer.  In this case,
        the `offset` and `strides` keywords are available.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    titles : tuple of str, optional
        Aliases for column names.  For example, if `names` were
        ``('x', 'y', 'z')`` and `titles` is
        ``('x_coordinate', 'y_coordinate', 'z_coordinate')``, then
        ``arr['x']`` is equivalent to both ``arr.x`` and ``arr.x_coordinate``.
    byteorder : {'<', '>', '='}, optional
        Byte-order for all fields.
    aligned : bool, optional
        Align the fields in memory as the C-compiler would.
    strides : tuple of ints, optional
        Buffer (`buf`) is interpreted according to these strides (strides
        define how many bytes each array element, row, column, etc.
        occupy in memory).
    offset : int, optional
        Start reading buffer (`buf`) from this offset onwards.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
        Row-major (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) order.

    Returns
    -------
    rec : recarray
        Empty array of the given shape and type.

    See Also
    --------
    rec.fromrecords : Construct a record array from data.
    record : fundamental data-type for `recarray`.
    format_parser : determine a data-type from formats, names, titles.

    Notes
    -----
    This constructor can be compared to ``empty``: it creates a new record
    array but does not fill it with data.  To create a record array from data,
    use one of the following methods:

    1. Create a standard ndarray and convert it to a record array,
       using ``arr.view(np.recarray)``
    2. Use the `buf` keyword.
    3. Use `np.rec.fromrecords`.

    Examples
    --------
    Create an array with two fields, ``x`` and ``y``:

    >>> x = np.array([(1.0, 2), (3.0, 4)], dtype=[('x', float), ('y', int)])
    >>> x
    array([(1.0, 2), (3.0, 4)],
          dtype=[('x', '<f8'), ('y', '<i4')])

    >>> x['x']
    array([ 1.,  3.])

    View the array as a record array:

    >>> x = x.view(np.recarray)

    >>> x.x
    array([ 1.,  3.])

    >>> x.y
    array([2, 4])

    Create a new, empty record array:

    >>> np.recarray((2,),
    ... dtype=[('x', int), ('y', float), ('z', int)]) #doctest: +SKIP
    rec.array([(-1073741821, 1.2249118382103472e-301, 24547520),
           (3471280, 1.2134086255804012e-316, 0)],

    Join a sequence of arrays along a new axis.

    The `axis` parameter specifies the index of the new axis in the dimensions
    of the result. For example, if ``axis=0`` it will be the first dimension
    and if ``axis=-1`` it will be the last dimension.

    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    arrays : sequence of array_like
        Each array must have the same shape.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis in the result array along which the input arrays are stacked.
    out : ndarray, optional
        If provided, the destination to place the result. The shape must be
        correct, matching that of what stack would have returned if no
        out argument were specified.

    Returns
    -------
    stacked : ndarray
        The stacked array has one more dimension than the input arrays.

    See Also
    --------
    concatenate : Join a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.
    split : Split array into a list of multiple sub-arrays of equal size.

    arysoffsets_at_axis
    View inputs as arrays with at least three dimensions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arys1, arys2, ... : array_like
        One or more array-like sequences.  Non-array inputs are converted to
        arrays.  Arrays that already have three or more dimensions are
        preserved.

    Returns
    -------
    res1, res2, ... : ndarray
        An array, or list of arrays, each with ``a.ndim >= 3``.  Copies are
        avoided where possible, and views with three or more dimensions are
        returned.  For example, a 1-D array of shape ``(N,)`` becomes a view
        of shape ``(1, N, 1)``, and a 2-D array of shape ``(M, N)`` becomes a
        view of shape ``(M, N, 1)``.

    first_shape_preshape_at_axis/home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/core/shape_base.pyF_orderthe_slice
    Returns the shape of the final array, along with a list
    of slices and a list of arrays that can be used for assignment inside the
    new array

    Parameters
    ----------
    arrays : nested list of arrays
        The arrays to check
    max_depth : list of int
        The number of nested lists
    result_ndim: int
        The number of dimensions in thefinal array.

    Returns
    -------
    shape : tuple of int
        The shape that the final array will take on.
    slices: list of tuple of slices
        The slices into the full array required for assignment. These are
        required to be prepended with ``(Ellipsis, )`` to obtain to correct
        final index.
    arrays: list of ndarray
        The data to assign to each slice of the full array

    List depths are mismatched. First element was at depth {}, but there is an element at depth {} ({})Given array shapes, return the resulting shape and slices prefixes.

    These help in nested concatation.
    Returns
    -------
    shape: tuple of int
        This tuple satisfies:
        ```
        shape, _ = _concatenate_shapes([arr.shape for shape in arrs], axis)
        shape == concatenate(arrs, axis).shape
        ```

    slice_prefixes: tuple of (slice(start, end), )
        For a list of arrays being concatenated, this returns the slice
        in the larger array at axis that needs to be sliced into.

        For example, the following holds:
        ```
        ret = concatenate([a, b, c], axis)
        _, (sl_a, sl_b, sl_c) = concatenate_slices([a, b, c], axis)

        ret[(slice(None),) * axis + sl_a] == a
        ret[(slice(None),) * axis + sl_b] == b
        ret[(slice(None),) * axis + sl_c] == c
        ```

        Thses are called slice prefixes since they are used in the recursive
        blocking algorithm to compute the left-most slices during the
        recursion. Therefore, they must be prepended to rest of the slice
        that was computed deeper in the recusion.

        These are returned as tuples to ensure that they can quickly be added
        to existing slice tuple without creating a new tuple everytime.

    
    View inputs as arrays with at least two dimensions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arys1, arys2, ... : array_like
        One or more array-like sequences.  Non-array inputs are converted
        to arrays.  Arrays that already have two or more dimensions are
        preserved.

    Returns
    -------
    res, res2, ... : ndarray
        An array, or list of arrays, each with ``a.ndim >= 2``.
        Copies are avoided where possible, and views with two or more
        dimensions are returned.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.atleast_2d(3.0)

    >>> np.atleast_2d(x)
    array([[ 0.,  1.,  2.]])
    >>> np.atleast_2d(x).base is x
    True

    >>> np.atleast_2d(1, [1, 2], [[1, 2]])
    [array([[1]]), array([[1, 2]]), array([[1, 2]])]

    _block_slicingexpanded_arraysidx_str
    Assemble an nd-array from nested lists of blocks.

    Blocks in the innermost lists are concatenated (see `concatenate`) along
    the last dimension (-1), then these are concatenated along the
    second-last dimension (-2), and so on until the outermost list is reached.

    Blocks can be of any dimension, but will not be broadcasted using the normal
    rules. Instead, leading axes of size 1 are inserted, to make ``block.ndim``
    the same for all blocks. This is primarily useful for working with scalars,
    and means that code like ``np.block([v, 1])`` is valid, where
    ``v.ndim == 1``.

    When the nested list is two levels deep, this allows block matrices to be
    constructed from their components.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    arrays : nested list of array_like or scalars (but not tuples)
        If passed a single ndarray or scalar (a nested list of depth 0), this
        is returned unmodified (and not copied).

        Elements shapes must match along the appropriate axes (without
        broadcasting), but leading 1s will be prepended to the shape as
        necessary to make the dimensions match.

    Returns
    -------
    block_array : ndarray
        The array assembled from the given blocks.

        The dimensionality of the output is equal to the greatest of:
        * the dimensionality of all the inputs
        * the depth to which the input list is nested

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        * If list depths are mismatched - for instance, ``[[a, b], c]`` is
          illegal, and should be spelt ``[[a, b], [c]]``
        * If lists are empty - for instance, ``[[a, b], []]``

    See Also
    --------
    concatenate : Join a sequence of arrays together.
    stack : Stack arrays in sequence along a new dimension.
    hstack : Stack arrays in sequence horizontally (column wise).
    vstack : Stack arrays in sequence vertically (row wise).
    dstack : Stack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third dimension).
    vsplit : Split array into a list of multiple sub-arrays vertically.

    Notes
    -----

    When called with only scalars, ``np.block`` is equivalent to an ndarray
    call. So ``np.block([[1, 2], [3, 4]])`` is equivalent to
    ``np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])``.

    This function does not enforce that the blocks lie on a fixed grid.
    ``np.block([[a, b], [c, d]])`` is not restricted to arrays of the form::

        AAAbb
        AAAbb
        cccDD

    But is also allowed to produce, for some ``a, b, c, d``::

        AAAbb
        AAAbb
        cDDDD

    Since concatenation happens along the last axis first, `block` is _not_
    capable of producing the following directly::

        AAAbb
        cccbb
        cccDD

    Matlab's "square bracket stacking", ``[A, B, ...; p, q, ...]``, is
    equivalent to ``np.block([[A, B, ...], [p, q, ...]])``.

    Examples
    --------
    The most common use of this function is to build a block matrix

    >>> A = np.eye(2) * 2
    >>> B = np.eye(3) * 3
    >>> np.block([
    ...     [A,               np.zeros((2, 3))],
    ...     [np.ones((3, 2)), B               ]
    ... ])
    array([[ 2.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  2.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 1.,  1.,  3.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 1.,  1.,  0.,  3.,  0.],
           [ 1.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  3.]])

    With a list of depth 1, `block` can be used as `hstack`

    >>> np.block([1, 2, 3])              # hstack([1, 2, 3])
    array([1, 2, 3])

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> b = np.array([2, 3, 4])
    >>> np.block([a, b, 10])             # hstack([a, b, 10])
    array([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 10])

    >>> A = np.ones((2, 2), int)
    >>> B = 2 * A
    >>> np.block([A, B])                 # hstack([A, B])
    array([[1, 1, 2, 2],
           [1, 1, 2, 2]])

    With a list of depth 2, `block` can be used in place of `vstack`:

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> b = np.array([2, 3, 4])
    >>> np.block([[a], [b]])             # vstack([a, b])
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [2, 3, 4]])

    >>> A = np.ones((2, 2), int)
    >>> B = 2 * A
    >>> np.block([[A], [B]])             # vstack([A, B])
    array([[1, 1],
           [1, 1],
           [2, 2],
           [2, 2]])

    It can also be used in places of `atleast_1d` and `atleast_2d`

    >>> a = np.array(0)
    >>> b = np.array([1])
    >>> np.block([a])                    # atleast_1d(a)
    array([0])
    >>> np.block([b])                    # atleast_1d(b)
    array([1])

    >>> np.block([[a]])                  # atleast_2d(a)
    array([[0]])
    >>> np.block([[b]])                  # atleast_2d(b)
    array([[1]])


    bottom_indexarr_ndim_atleast_1d_dispatcher{} is a tuple. Only lists can be used to arrange blocks, and np.block does not allow implicit conversion from tuple to ndarray.
    Stack arrays in sequence horizontally (column wise).

    This is equivalent to concatenation along the second axis, except for 1-D
    arrays where it concatenates along the first axis. Rebuilds arrays divided
    by `hsplit`.

    This function makes most sense for arrays with up to 3 dimensions. For
    instance, for pixel-data with a height (first axis), width (second axis),
    and r/g/b channels (third axis). The functions `concatenate`, `stack` and
    `block` provide more general stacking and concatenation operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tup : sequence of ndarrays
        The arrays must have the same shape along all but the second axis,
        except 1-D arrays which can be any length.

    Returns
    -------
    stacked : ndarray
        The array formed by stacking the given arrays.

    See Also
    --------
    stack : Join a sequence of arrays along a new axis.
    vstack : Stack arrays in sequence vertically (row wise).
    dstack : Stack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third axis).
    concatenate : Join a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.
    hsplit : Split array along second axis.
    block : Assemble arrays from blocks.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array((1,2,3))
    >>> b = np.array((2,3,4))
    >>> np.hstack((a,b))
    array([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> a = np.array([[1],[2],[3]])
    >>> b = np.array([[2],[3],[4]])
    >>> np.hstack((a,b))
    array([[1, 2],

    List at {} cannot be emptyfirst_shape_postidxs_ndims_accumulate_block_slicing.<locals>.<genexpr>
    Internal implementation of block based on repeated concatenation.
    `arrays` is the argument passed to
    block. `max_depth` is the depth of nested lists within `arrays` and
    `result_ndim` is the greatest of the dimensions of the arrays in
    `arrays` and the depth of the lists in `arrays` (see block docstring
    for details).
    _block_format_index.<locals>.<genexpr>_atleast_2d_dispatcher_concatenate_shapes.<locals>.<genexpr>
    Convert a list of indices ``[0, 1, 2]`` into ``"arrays[0][1][2]"``.
    max_arr_ndim
    Recursive function checking that the depths of nested lists in `arrays`
    all match. Mismatch raises a ValueError as described in the block
    docstring below.

    The entire index (rather than just the depth) needs to be calculated
    for each innermost list, in case an error needs to be raised, so that
    the index of the offending list can be printed as part of the error.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arrays : nested list of arrays
        The arrays to check
    parent_index : list of int
        The full index of `arrays` within the nested lists passed to
        `_block_check_depths_match` at the top of the recursion.

    Returns

    first_index : list of int
        The full index of an element from the bottom of the nesting in
        `arrays`. If any element at the bottom is an empty list, this will
        refer to it, and the last index along the empty axis will be `None`.
    max_arr_ndim : int
        The maximum of the ndims of the arrays nested in `arrays`.
    final_size: int
        The number of elements in the final array. This is used the motivate
        the choice of algorithm used using benchmarking wisdom.

    _atleast_ndinner_slices
    Convert inputs to arrays with at least one dimension.

    Scalar inputs are converted to 1-dimensional arrays, whilst
    higher-dimensional inputs are preserved.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arys1, arys2, ... : array_like
        One or more input arrays.

    Returns
    -------
    ret : ndarray
        An array, or list of arrays, each with ``a.ndim >= 1``.
        Copies are made only if necessary.

    _block_info_recursion_block_check_depths_match.<locals>.<genexpr>
    Stack arrays in sequence vertically (row wise).

    This is equivalent to concatenation along the first axis after 1-D arrays
    of shape `(N,)` have been reshaped to `(1,N)`. Rebuilds arrays divided by
    `vsplit`.

    This function makes most sense for arrays with up to 3 dimensions. For
    instance, for pixel-data with a height (first axis), width (second axis),
    and r/g/b channels (third axis). The functions `concatenate`, `stack` and
    `block` provide more general stacking and concatenation operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tup : sequence of ndarrays
        The arrays must have the same shape along all but the first axis.
        1-D arrays must have the same length.

    Returns
    -------
    stacked : ndarray
        The array formed by stacking the given arrays, will be at least 2-D.

    See Also
    --------
    stack : Join a sequence of arrays along a new axis.
    hstack : Stack arrays in sequence horizontally (column wise).
    dstack : Stack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third dimension).
    concatenate : Join a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.
    vsplit : Split array into a list of multiple sub-arrays vertically.
    block : Assemble arrays from blocks.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> b = np.array([2, 3, 4])
    >>> np.vstack((a,b))
    array([[1, 2, 3],

    An ndpointer instance is used to describe an ndarray in restypes

    using, for example, ``POINTER(c_double)``, since several restrictions
    can be specified, which are verified upon calling the ctypes function.
    These include data type, number of dimensions, shape and flags.  If a
    given array does not satisfy the specified restrictions,
    a ``TypeError`` is raised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Array data-type.
    ndim : int, optional
        Number of array dimensions.
    shape : tuple of ints, optional
        Array shape.

        It is possible to load a library using

Examples
--------
Load the C library:

>>> _lib = np.ctypeslib.load_library('libmystuff', '.')     #doctest: +SKIP

Our result type, an ndarray that must be of type double, be 1-dimensional
and is C-contiguous in memory:

>>> array_1d_double = np.ctypeslib.ndpointer(
...                          dtype=np.double,
...                          ndim=1, flags='CONTIGUOUS')    #doctest: +SKIP

Our C-function typically takes an array and updates its values
in-place.  For example::

    void foo_func(double* x, int length)
    {
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            x[i] = i*i;
        }
    }

We wrap it using:

>>> _lib.foo_func.restype = None                      #doctest: +SKIP
>>> _lib.foo_func.argtypes = [array_1d_double, c_int] #doctest: +SKIP

Then, we're ready to call ``foo_func``:

>>> out = np.empty(15, dtype=np.double)
>>> _lib.foo_func(out, len(out))                #doctest: +SKIP

    Compute the 2-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform

    This function computes the *n*-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform
    over any axes in an *M*-dimensional array by means of the
    Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).  By default, the transform is computed over
    the last two axes of the input array, i.e., a 2-dimensional FFT.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array, can be complex
    s : sequence of ints, optional
        Shape (length of each transformed axis) of the output
        (``s[0]`` refers to axis 0, ``s[1]`` to axis 1, etc.).
        This corresponds to ``n`` for ``fft(x, n)``.
        Along each axis, if the given shape is smaller than that of the input,
        the input is cropped.  If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.
        if `s` is not given, the shape of the input along the axes specified
        by `axes` is used.
    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        Axes over which to compute the FFT.  If not given, the last two
        axes are used.  A repeated index in `axes` means the transform over
        that axis is performed multiple times.  A one-element sequence means
        that a one-dimensional FFT is performed.
    norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    out : complex ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axes
        indicated by `axes`, or the last two axes if `axes` is not given.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `s` and `axes` have different length, or `axes` not given and
        ``len(s) != 2``.
    IndexError
        If an element of `axes` is larger than than the number of axes of `a`.

    Notes
    -----
    `fft2` is just `fftn` with a different default for `axes`.

    The output, analogously to `fft`, contains the term for zero frequency in
    the low-order corner of the transformed axes, the positive frequency terms
    in the first half of these axes, the term for the Nyquist frequency in the
    middle of the axes and the negative frequency terms in the second half of
    the axes, in order of decreasingly negative frequency.

    See `fftn` for details and a plotting example, and `numpy.fft` for
    definitions and conventions used.

    Compute the one-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform for real input.

    This function computes the one-dimensional *n*-point discrete Fourier
    Transform (DFT) of a real-valued array by means of an efficient algorithm
    called the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array
    n : int, optional
        Number of points along transformation axis in the input to use.
        If `n` is smaller than the length of the input, the input is cropped.
        If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros. If `n` is not given,
        the length of the input along the axis specified by `axis` is used.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to compute the FFT. If not given, the last axis is
        used.
    norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    out : complex ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axis
        indicated by `axis`, or the last one if `axis` is not specified.
        If `n` is even, the length of the transformed axis is ``(n/2)+1``.
        If `n` is odd, the length is ``(n+1)/2``.

    Raises
    ------
    IndexError
        If `axis` is larger than the last axis of `a`.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.fft : For definition of the DFT and conventions used.
    irfft : The inverse of `rfft`.
    fft : The one-dimensional FFT of general (complex) input.
    fftn : The *n*-dimensional FFT.
    rfftn : The *n*-dimensional FFT of real input.

    Notes
    -----
    When the DFT is computed for purely real input, the output is
    Hermitian-symmetric, i.e. the negative frequency terms are just the complex
    conjugates of the corresponding positive-frequency terms, and the
    negative-frequency terms are therefore redundant.  This function does not
    compute the negative frequency terms, and the length of the transformed
    axis of the output is therefore ``n//2 + 1``.

    When ``A = rfft(a)`` and fs is the sampling frequency, ``A[0]`` contains
    the zero-frequency term 0*fs, which is real due to Hermitian symmetry.

    If `n` is even, ``A[-1]`` contains the term representing both positive
    and negative Nyquist frequency (+fs/2 and -fs/2), and must also be purely
    real. If `n` is odd, there is no term at fs/2; ``A[-1]`` contains
    the largest positive frequency (fs/2*(n-1)/n), and is complex in the
    general case.

    If the input `a` contains an imaginary part, it is silently discarded.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.fft.fft([0, 1, 0, 0])
    array([ 1.+0.j,  0.-1.j, -1.+0.j,  0.+1.j])
    >>> np.fft.rfft([0, 1, 0, 0])
    array([ 1.+0.j,  0.-1.j, -1.+0.j])

    Notice how the final element of the `fft` output is the complex conjugate
    of the second element, for real input. For `rfft`, this symmetry is
    exploited to compute only the non-negative frequency terms.

    
    Compute the FFT of a signal that has Hermitian symmetry, i.e., a real
    spectrum.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The input array.
    n : int, optional
        Length of the transformed axis of the output. For `n` output
        points, ``n//2 + 1`` input points are necessary.  If the input is
        longer than this, it is cropped.  If it is shorter than this, it is
        padded with zeros.  If `n` is not given, it is determined from the
        length of the input along the axis specified by `axis`.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to compute the FFT. If not given, the last
        axis is used.
    norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.

        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axis
        indicated by `axis`, or the last one if `axis` is not specified.
        The length of the transformed axis is `n`, or, if `n` is not given,
        ``2*m - 2`` where ``m`` is the length of the transformed axis of
        the input. To get an odd number of output points, `n` must be
        specified, for instance as ``2*m - 1`` in the typical case,

    Raises
    ------
    IndexError
        If `axis` is larger than the last axis of `a`.

    rfft : Compute the one-dimensional FFT for real input.
    ihfft : The inverse of `hfft`.

    Notes
    -----
    `hfft`/`ihfft` are a pair analogous to `rfft`/`irfft`, but for the
    opposite case: here the signal has Hermitian symmetry in the time
    domain and is real in the frequency domain. So here it's `hfft` for
    which you must supply the length of the result if it is to be odd.

    * even: ``ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 2) == a``, within roundoff error,
    * odd: ``ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 1) == a``, within roundoff error.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> signal = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2])
    >>> np.fft.fft(signal)

    _unitaryirfftn
    Compute the 2-dimensional inverse FFT of a real array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The input array
    s : sequence of ints, optional
        Shape of the inverse FFT.
    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        The axes over which to compute the inverse fft.
        Default is the last two axes.
    norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The result of the inverse real 2-D FFT.

    See Also
    --------
    irfftn : Compute the inverse of the N-dimensional FFT of real input.

    Notes
    -----
    This is really `irfftn` with different defaults.
    For more details see `irfftn`.

    
    Compute the one-dimensional inverse discrete Fourier Transform.

    This function computes the inverse of the one-dimensional *n*-point
    discrete Fourier transform computed by `fft`.  In other words,
    ``ifft(fft(a)) == a`` to within numerical accuracy.
    For a general description of the algorithm and definitions,
    see `numpy.fft`.

    The input should be ordered in the same way as is returned by `fft`,
    i.e.,

    * ``a[0]`` should contain the zero frequency term,
    * ``a[1:n//2]`` should contain the positive-frequency terms,
    * ``a[n//2 + 1:]`` should contain the negative-frequency terms, in
      increasing order starting from the most negative frequency.

    For an even number of input points, ``A[n//2]`` represents the sum of
    the values at the positive and negative Nyquist frequencies, as the two
    are aliased together. See `numpy.fft` for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array, can be complex.
    n : int, optional
        Length of the transformed axis of the output.
        If `n` is smaller than the length of the input, the input is cropped.
        If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.  If `n` is not given,
        the length of the input along the axis specified by `axis` is used.
        See notes about padding issues.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to compute the inverse DFT.  If not given, the last
        axis is used.
    norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    out : complex ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axis
        indicated by `axis`, or the last one if `axis` is not specified.

    Raises
    ------
    IndexError
        If `axes` is larger than the last axis of `a`.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.fft : An introduction, with definitions and general explanations.
    fft : The one-dimensional (forward) FFT, of which `ifft` is the inverse
    ifft2 : The two-dimensional inverse FFT.
    ifftn : The n-dimensional inverse FFT.

    Notes
    -----
    If the input parameter `n` is larger than the size of the input, the input
    is padded by appending zeros at the end.  Even though this is the common
    approach, it might lead to surprising results.  If a different padding is
    desired, it must be performed before calling `ifft`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.fft.ifft([0, 4, 0, 0])
    array([ 1.+0.j,  0.+1.j, -1.+0.j,  0.-1.j])

    Create and plot a band-limited signal with random phases:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> t = np.arange(400)
    >>> n = np.zeros((400,), dtype=complex)
    >>> n[40:60] = np.exp(1j*np.random.uniform(0, 2*np.pi, (20,)))
    >>> s = np.fft.ifft(n)
    >>> plt.plot(t, s.real, 'b-', t, s.imag, 'r--')
    ...
    >>> plt.legend(('real', 'imaginary'))
    ...
    >>> plt.show()

    cfftishapeless
    Compute the inverse of the n-point DFT for real input.

    This function computes the inverse of the one-dimensional *n*-point
    discrete Fourier Transform of real input computed by `rfft`.
    In other words, ``irfft(rfft(a), len(a)) == a`` to within numerical
    accuracy. (See Notes below for why ``len(a)`` is necessary here.)

    The input is expected to be in the form returned by `rfft`, i.e. the
    real zero-frequency term followed by the complex positive frequency terms
    in order of increasing frequency.  Since the discrete Fourier Transform of
    real input is Hermitian-symmetric, the negative frequency terms are taken
    to be the complex conjugates of the corresponding positive frequency terms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The input array.
    n : int, optional
        Length of the transformed axis of the output.
        For `n` output points, ``n//2+1`` input points are necessary.  If the
        input is longer than this, it is cropped.  If it is shorter than this,
        it is padded with zeros.  If `n` is not given, it is determined from
        the length of the input along the axis specified by `axis`.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to compute the inverse FFT. If not given, the last
        axis is used.
    norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axis
        indicated by `axis`, or the last one if `axis` is not specified.
        The length of the transformed axis is `n`, or, if `n` is not given,
        ``2*(m-1)`` where ``m`` is the length of the transformed axis of the
        input. To get an odd number of output points, `n` must be specified.

    Raises
    ------
    IndexError
        If `axis` is larger than the last axis of `a`.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.fft : For definition of the DFT and conventions used.
    rfft : The one-dimensional FFT of real input, of which `irfft` is inverse.
    fft : The one-dimensional FFT.
    irfft2 : The inverse of the two-dimensional FFT of real input.
    irfftn : The inverse of the *n*-dimensional FFT of real input.

    Notes
    -----
    Returns the real valued `n`-point inverse discrete Fourier transform
    of `a`, where `a` contains the non-negative frequency terms of a
    Hermitian-symmetric sequence. `n` is the length of the result, not the
    input.

    If you specify an `n` such that `a` must be zero-padded or truncated, the
    extra/removed values will be added/removed at high frequencies. One can
    thus resample a series to `m` points via Fourier interpolation by:
    ``a_resamp = irfft(rfft(a), m)``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.fft.ifft([1, -1j, -1, 1j])
    array([ 0.+0.j,  1.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0.+0.j])
    >>> np.fft.irfft([1, -1j, -1])
    array([ 0.,  1.,  0.,  0.])

    Notice how the last term in the input to the ordinary `ifft` is the
    complex conjugate of the second term, and the output has zero imaginary
    part everywhere.  When calling `irfft`, the negative frequencies are not
    specified, and the output array is purely real.

    
    Compute the one-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform.

    This function computes the one-dimensional *n*-point discrete Fourier
    Transform (DFT) with the efficient Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
    algorithm [CT].

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array, can be complex.
    n : int, optional
        Length of the transformed axis of the output.
        If `n` is smaller than the length of the input, the input is cropped.
        If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.  If `n` is not given,
        the length of the input along the axis specified by `axis` is used.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to compute the FFT.  If not given, the last axis is
        used.
    norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    out : complex ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axis
        indicated by `axis`, or the last one if `axis` is not specified.

    Raises
    ------
    IndexError
        if `axes` is larger than the last axis of `a`.

    See Also
    --------

    ifft : The inverse of `fft`.
    fft2 : The two-dimensional FFT.
    fftn : The *n*-dimensional FFT.
    rfftn : The *n*-dimensional FFT of real input.
    fftfreq : Frequency bins for given FFT parameters.

    Notes
    -----
    FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) refers to a way the discrete Fourier
    Transform (DFT) can be calculated efficiently, by using symmetries in the
    calculated terms.  The symmetry is highest when `n` is a power of 2, and
    the transform is therefore most efficient for these sizes.

    The DFT is defined, with the conventions used in this implementation, in
    the documentation for the `numpy.fft` module.

fftpack_lite/home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/fft/fftpack.pynumpy.fft.fftpack_cook_nd_argsrfftf
    Compute the N-dimensional inverse discrete Fourier Transform.

    This function computes the inverse of the N-dimensional discrete
    Fourier Transform over any number of axes in an M-dimensional array by
    means of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).  In other words,
    ``ifftn(fftn(a)) == a`` to within numerical accuracy.
    For a description of the definitions and conventions used, see `numpy.fft`.

    The input, analogously to `ifft`, should be ordered in the same way as is
    returned by `fftn`, i.e. it should have the term for zero frequency
    in all axes in the low-order corner, the positive frequency terms in the
    first half of all axes, the term for the Nyquist frequency in the middle
    of all axes and the negative frequency terms in the second half of all
    axes, in order of decreasingly negative frequency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array, can be complex.
    s : sequence of ints, optional
        Shape (length of each transformed axis) of the output
        (``s[0]`` refers to axis 0, ``s[1]`` to axis 1, etc.).
        This corresponds to ``n`` for ``ifft(x, n)``.
        Along any axis, if the given shape is smaller than that of the input,
        the input is cropped.  If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.
        if `s` is not given, the shape of the input along the axes specified
        by `axes` is used.  See notes for issue on `ifft` zero padding.
    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        Axes over which to compute the IFFT.  If not given, the last ``len(s)``
        axes are used, or all axes if `s` is also not specified.
        Repeated indices in `axes` means that the inverse transform over that
        axis is performed multiple times.
    norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    out : complex ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axes
        indicated by `axes`, or by a combination of `s` or `a`,
        as explained in the parameters section above.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `s` and `axes` have different length.
    IndexError
        If an element of `axes` is larger than than the number of axes of `a`.

    ifft2 : The two-dimensional inverse FFT.
    ifftshift : Undoes `fftshift`, shifts zero-frequency terms to beginning
        of array.

    Notes
    -----
    See `numpy.fft` for definitions and conventions used.

    Zero-padding, analogously with `ifft`, is performed by appending zeros to
    the input along the specified dimension.  Although this is the common
    approach, it might lead to surprising results.  If another form of zero
    padding is desired, it must be performed before `ifftn` is called.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.eye(4)
    >>> np.fft.ifftn(np.fft.fftn(a, axes=(0,)), axes=(1,))
    array([[ 1.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0.+0.j],

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array
        Input array, taken to be real.

        Shape of the FFT.
    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        Axes over which to compute the FFT.
    norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The result of the real 2-D FFT.

    See Also
    --------
    rfftn : Compute the N-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform for real
            input.

    Notes
    -----
    This is really just `rfftn` with different default behavior.
    For more details see `rfftn`.

    
    Compute the 2-dimensional inverse discrete Fourier Transform.

    This function computes the inverse of the 2-dimensional discrete Fourier
    Transform over any number of axes in an M-dimensional array by means of
    the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).  In other words, ``ifft2(fft2(a)) == a``
    to within numerical accuracy.  By default, the inverse transform is
    computed over the last two axes of the input array.

    The input, analogously to `ifft`, should be ordered in the same way as is
    returned by `fft2`, i.e. it should have the term for zero frequency
    in the low-order corner of the two axes, the positive frequency terms in
    the first half of these axes, the term for the Nyquist frequency in the
    middle of the axes and the negative frequency terms in the second half of
    both axes, in order of decreasingly negative frequency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array, can be complex.
    s : sequence of ints, optional
        Shape (length of each axis) of the output (``s[0]`` refers to axis 0,
        ``s[1]`` to axis 1, etc.).  This corresponds to `n` for ``ifft(x, n)``.
        Along each axis, if the given shape is smaller than that of the input,
        the input is cropped.  If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.
        if `s` is not given, the shape of the input along the axes specified
        by `axes` is used.  See notes for issue on `ifft` zero padding.
    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        Axes over which to compute the FFT.  If not given, the last two
        axes are used.  A repeated index in `axes` means the transform over
        that axis is performed multiple times.  A one-element sequence means
        that a one-dimensional FFT is performed.
    norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    out : complex ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axes
        indicated by `axes`, or the last two axes if `axes` is not given.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `s` and `axes` have different length, or `axes` not given and
        ``len(s) != 2``.
    IndexError
        If an element of `axes` is larger than than the number of axes of `a`.

    ifftn : The inverse of the *n*-dimensional FFT.
    fft : The one-dimensional FFT.

    Notes
    -----
    `ifft2` is just `ifftn` with a different default for `axes`.

    See `ifftn` for details and a plotting example, and `numpy.fft` for
    definition and conventions used.

    Zero-padding, analogously with `ifft`, is performed by appending zeros to
    the input along the specified dimension.  Although this is the common
    approach, it might lead to surprising results.  If another form of zero
    padding is desired, it must be performed before `ifft2` is called.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = 4 * np.eye(4)
    >>> np.fft.ifft2(a)
    array([[ 1.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0.+0.j],
           [ 0.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  1.+0.j],

    Compute the inverse of the N-dimensional FFT of real input.

    This function computes the inverse of the N-dimensional discrete
    Fourier Transform for real input over any number of axes in an
    M-dimensional array by means of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).  In
    other words, ``irfftn(rfftn(a), a.shape) == a`` to within numerical
    accuracy. (The ``a.shape`` is necessary like ``len(a)`` is for `irfft`,
    and for the same reason.)

    The input should be ordered in the same way as is returned by `rfftn`,
    i.e. as for `irfft` for the final transformation axis, and as for `ifftn`
    along all the other axes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    s : sequence of ints, optional
        Shape (length of each transformed axis) of the output
        (``s[0]`` refers to axis 0, ``s[1]`` to axis 1, etc.). `s` is also the
        number of input points used along this axis, except for the last axis,
        where ``s[-1]//2+1`` points of the input are used.
        Along any axis, if the shape indicated by `s` is smaller than that of
        the input, the input is cropped.  If it is larger, the input is padded
        with zeros. If `s` is not given, the shape of the input along the
        axes specified by `axes` is used.
    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        Axes over which to compute the inverse FFT. If not given, the last
        `len(s)` axes are used, or all axes if `s` is also not specified.
        Repeated indices in `axes` means that the inverse transform over that
        axis is performed multiple times.
    norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axes
        indicated by `axes`, or by a combination of `s` or `a`,
        as explained in the parameters section above.
        The length of each transformed axis is as given by the corresponding
        element of `s`, or the length of the input in every axis except for the
        last one if `s` is not given.  In the final transformed axis the length
        of the output when `s` is not given is ``2*(m-1)`` where ``m`` is the
        length of the final transformed axis of the input.  To get an odd
        number of output points in the final axis, `s` must be specified.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `s` and `axes` have different length.
    IndexError
        If an element of `axes` is larger than than the number of axes of `a`.

    _raw_fft
    Compute the N-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform for real input.

    This function computes the N-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform over
    any number of axes in an M-dimensional real array by means of the Fast
    Fourier Transform (FFT).  By default, all axes are transformed, with the
    real transform performed over the last axis, while the remaining
    transforms are complex.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array, taken to be real.
    s : sequence of ints, optional
        Shape (length along each transformed axis) to use from the input.
        (``s[0]`` refers to axis 0, ``s[1]`` to axis 1, etc.).
        The final element of `s` corresponds to `n` for ``rfft(x, n)``, while
        for the remaining axes, it corresponds to `n` for ``fft(x, n)``.
        Along any axis, if the given shape is smaller than that of the input,
        the input is cropped.  If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.
        if `s` is not given, the shape of the input along the axes specified
        by `axes` is used.
    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        Axes over which to compute the FFT.  If not given, the last ``len(s)``
        axes are used, or all axes if `s` is also not specified.
    norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    out : complex ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axes
        indicated by `axes`, or by a combination of `s` and `a`,
        as explained in the parameters section above.
        The length of the last axis transformed will be ``s[-1]//2+1``,
        while the remaining transformed axes will have lengths according to
        `s`, or unchanged from the input.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `s` and `axes` have different length.
    IndexError
        If an element of `axes` is larger than than the number of axes of `a`.

    See Also
    --------
    irfftn : The inverse of `rfftn`, i.e. the inverse of the n-dimensional FFT
         of real input.
    fft : The one-dimensional FFT, with definitions and conventions used.
    rfft : The one-dimensional FFT of real input.
    fftn : The n-dimensional FFT.
    rfft2 : The two-dimensional FFT of real input.

    Notes
    -----
    The transform for real input is performed over the last transformation
    axis, as by `rfft`, then the transform over the remaining axes is
    performed as by `fftn`.  The order of the output is as for `rfft` for the
    final transformation axis, and as for `fftn` for the remaining
    transformation axes.

    See `fft` for details, definitions and conventions used.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.ones((2, 2, 2))
    >>> np.fft.rfftn(a)
    array([[[ 8.+0.j,  0.+0.j],
            [ 0.+0.j,  0.+0.j]],
           [[ 0.+0.j,  0.+0.j],

            [ 0.+0.j,  0.+0.j]]])

    _raw_fftnd
    Compute the inverse FFT of a signal that has Hermitian symmetry.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    n : int, optional
        Length of the inverse FFT, the number of points along
        transformation axis in the input to use.  If `n` is smaller than
        the length of the input, the input is cropped.  If it is larger,
        the input is padded with zeros. If `n` is not given, the length of
        the input along the axis specified by `axis` is used.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to compute the inverse FFT. If not given, the last
        axis is used.
    norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.

        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : complex ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axis
        indicated by `axis`, or the last one if `axis` is not specified.
        The length of the transformed axis is ``n//2 + 1``.

    --------
    hfft, irfft

    Notes
    -----
    `hfft`/`ihfft` are a pair analogous to `rfft`/`irfft`, but for the
    opposite case: here the signal has Hermitian symmetry in the time
    domain and is real in the frequency domain. So here it's `hfft` for
    which you must supply the length of the result if it is to be odd:

    * even: ``ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 2) == a``, within roundoff error,
    * odd: ``ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 1) == a``, within roundoff error.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> spectrum = np.array([ 15, -4, 0, -1, 0, -4])
    >>> np.fft.ifft(spectrum)
    array([ 1.+0.j,  2.-0.j,  3.+0.j,  4.+0.j,  3.+0.j,  2.-0.j])

    _fftn_dispatcherInvalid number of FFT data points (%d) specified.cfftb_fft_cacheinvreal<module numpy.fft.fftpack>cfftf
    Compute the N-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform.

    This function computes the *N*-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform over
    any number of axes in an *M*-dimensional array by means of the Fast Fourier
    Transform (FFT).

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array, can be complex.
    s : sequence of ints, optional
        Shape (length of each transformed axis) of the output
        (``s[0]`` refers to axis 0, ``s[1]`` to axis 1, etc.).
        This corresponds to ``n`` for ``fft(x, n)``.
        Along any axis, if the given shape is smaller than that of the input,
        the input is cropped.  If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.
        if `s` is not given, the shape of the input along the axes specified
        by `axes` is used.
    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        Axes over which to compute the FFT.  If not given, the last ``len(s)``
        axes are used, or all axes if `s` is also not specified.
        Repeated indices in `axes` means that the transform over that axis is
        performed multiple times.
    norm : {None, "ortho"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is None.

    first half of all axes, the term for the Nyquist frequency in the middle
    of all axes and the negative frequency terms in the second half of all
    axes, in order of decreasingly negative frequency.

    _real_fft_cacherfftbnumpy.fft.helper/home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/fft/helper.py_max_size_in_bytes_FFTCache.pop_twiddle_factors
    Cache for the FFT twiddle factors as an LRU (least recently used) cache.

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_size_in_mb : int
        Maximum memory usage of the cache before items are being evicted.
    max_item_count : int
        Maximum item count of the cache before items are being evicted.

    Notes
    -----
    Items will be evicted if either limit has been reached upon getting and
    setting. The maximum memory usages is not strictly the given
    ``max_size_in_mb`` but rather
    ``max(max_size_in_mb, 1.5 * size_of_largest_item)``. Thus the cache will
    never be completely cleared - at least one item will remain and a single
    large item can cause the cache to retain several smaller items even if the
    given maximum cache size has been exceeded.
    
        Pop twiddle factors for an FFT of length n from the cache.

        Will return None if the requested twiddle factors are not available in
        the cache.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            Data length for the FFT.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or None
            The retrieved twiddle factors if available, else None.
        n should be an integer_FFTCache.__init___FFTCache._prune_cache_FFTCache._check_size.<locals>.listcomp.<locals>.<genexpr>_FFTCache.put_twiddle_factors
        Store twiddle factors for an FFT of length n in the cache.

        Putting multiple twiddle factors for a certain n will store it multiple
        times.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            Data length for the FFT.
        factors : ndarray
            The actual twiddle values.
        
    Return the Discrete Fourier Transform sample frequencies
    (for usage with rfft, irfft).

    The returned float array `f` contains the frequency bin centers in cycles
    per unit of the sample spacing (with zero at the start).  For instance, if
    the sample spacing is in seconds, then the frequency unit is cycles/second.

    Given a window length `n` and a sample spacing `d`::

      f = [0, 1, ...,     n/2-1,     n/2] / (d*n)   if n is even
      f = [0, 1, ..., (n-1)/2-1, (n-1)/2] / (d*n)   if n is odd

    Unlike `fftfreq` (but like `scipy.fftpack.rfftfreq`)
    the Nyquist frequency component is considered to be positive.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Window length.
    d : scalar, optional
        Sample spacing (inverse of the sampling rate). Defaults to 1.

    Returns
    -------
    f : ndarray
        Array of length ``n//2 + 1`` containing the sample frequencies.

    --------
    >>> signal = np.array([-2, 8, 6, 4, 1, 0, 3, 5, -3, 4], dtype=float)
    >>> fourier = np.fft.rfft(signal)
    >>> n = signal.size
    >>> sample_rate = 100
    >>> freq = np.fft.fftfreq(n, d=1./sample_rate)
    >>> freq
    array([  0.,  10.,  20.,  30.,  40., -50., -40., -30., -20., -10.])
    >>> freq = np.fft.rfftfreq(n, d=1./sample_rate)
    >>> freq

    all_values_fftshift_dispatcher<module numpy.fft.helper>
    Shift the zero-frequency component to the center of the spectrum.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array.
    axes : int or shape tuple, optional
        Axes over which to shift.  Default is None, which shifts all axes.

    >>> np.fft.fftshift(freqs)
    array([-5., -4., -3., -2., -1.,  0.,  1.,  2.,  3.,  4.])

    Shift the zero-frequency component only along the second axis:

    >>> freqs = np.fft.fftfreq(9, d=1./9).reshape(3, 3)
    >>> freqs
    array([[ 0.,  1.,  2.],
           [ 3.,  4., -4.],
           [-3., -2., -1.]])
    >>> np.fft.fftshift(freqs, axes=(1,))
    array([[ 2.,  0.,  1.],
           [-4.,  3.,  4.],
           [-1., -3., -2.]])

    Return the Discrete Fourier Transform sample frequencies.

    The returned float array `f` contains the frequency bin centers in cycles

Background information
----------------------

Fourier analysis is fundamentally a method for expressing a function as a
sum of periodic components, and for recovering the function from those
components.  When both the function and its Fourier transform are
replaced with discretized counterparts, it is called the discrete Fourier
transform (DFT).  The DFT has become a mainstay of numerical computing in
part because of a very fast algorithm for computing it, called the Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT), which was known to Gauss (1805) and was brought
to light in its current form by Cooley and Tukey [CT]_.  Press et al. [NR]_
provide an accessible introduction to Fourier analysis and its
applications.

Because the discrete Fourier transform separates its input into
components that contribute at discrete frequencies, it has a great number
of applications in digital signal processing, e.g., for filtering, and in
this context the discretized input to the transform is customarily
referred to as a *signal*, which exists in the *time domain*.  The output
is called a *spectrum* or *transform* and exists in the *frequency
domain*.

Implementation details
----------------------

There are many ways to define the DFT, varying in the sign of the
exponent, normalization, etc.  In this implementation, the DFT is defined
as

.. math::
   A_k =  \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} a_m \exp\left\{-2\pi i{mk \over n}\right\}
   \qquad k = 0,\ldots,n-1.

The DFT is in general defined for complex inputs and outputs, and a
single-frequency component at linear frequency :math:`f` is
represented by a complex exponential
:math:`a_m = \exp\{2\pi i\,f m\Delta t\}`, where :math:`\Delta t`
is the sampling interval.

The values in the result follow so-called "standard" order: If ``A =
fft(a, n)``, then ``A[0]`` contains the zero-frequency term (the sum of
the signal), which is always purely real for real inputs. Then ``A[1:n/2]``
contains the positive-frequency terms, and ``A[n/2+1:]`` contains the
negative-frequency terms, in order of decreasingly negative frequency.
For an even number of input points, ``A[n/2]`` represents both positive and
negative Nyquist frequency, and is also purely real for real input.  For
an odd number of input points, ``A[(n-1)/2]`` contains the largest positive
frequency, while ``A[(n+1)/2]`` contains the largest negative frequency.
The routine ``np.fft.fftfreq(n)`` returns an array giving the frequencies
of corresponding elements in the output.  The routine
``np.fft.fftshift(A)`` shifts transforms and their frequencies to put the
zero-frequency components in the middle, and ``np.fft.ifftshift(A)`` undoes
that shift.

When the input `a` is a time-domain signal and ``A = fft(a)``, ``np.abs(A)``
is its amplitude spectrum and ``np.abs(A)**2`` is its power spectrum.
The phase spectrum is obtained by ``np.angle(A)``.

The inverse DFT is defined as

.. math::
   a_m = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}A_k\exp\left\{2\pi i{mk\over n}\right\}
   \qquad m = 0,\ldots,n-1.

It differs from the forward transform by the sign of the exponential
argument and the default normalization by :math:`1/n`.

Normalization
-------------
The default normalization has the direct transforms unscaled and the inverse
transforms are scaled by :math:`1/n`. It is possible to obtain unitary
transforms by setting the keyword argument ``norm`` to ``"ortho"`` (default is
`None`) so that both direct and inverse transforms will be scaled by
:math:`1/\sqrt{n}`.

Real and Hermitian transforms
-----------------------------

When the input is purely real, its transform is Hermitian, i.e., the
component at frequency :math:`f_k` is the complex conjugate of the
component at frequency :math:`-f_k`, which means that for real
inputs there is no information in the negative frequency components that
is not already available from the positive frequency components.
The family of `rfft` functions is
designed to operate on real inputs, and exploits this symmetry by
computing only the positive frequency components, up to and including the
Nyquist frequency.  Thus, ``n`` input points produce ``n/2+1`` complex
output points.  The inverses of this family assumes the same symmetry of
its input, and for an output of ``n`` points uses ``n/2+1`` input points.

Correspondingly, when the spectrum is purely real, the signal is
Hermitian.  The `hfft` family of functions exploits this symmetry by
using ``n/2+1`` complex points in the input (time) domain for ``n`` real
points in the frequency domain.

In higher dimensions, FFTs are used, e.g., for image analysis and
filtering.  The computational efficiency of the FFT means that it can
also be a faster way to compute large convolutions, using the property
that a convolution in the time domain is equivalent to a point-by-point
multiplication in the frequency domain.

Higher dimensions
-----------------

In two dimensions, the DFT is defined as

.. math::
   A_{kl} =  \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}
   a_{mn}\exp\left\{-2\pi i \left({mk\over M}+{nl\over N}\right)\right\}
   \qquad k = 0, \ldots, M-1;\quad l = 0, \ldots, N-1,

which extends in the obvious way to higher dimensions, and the inverses
in higher dimensions also extend in the same way.

        _baseurl
    DataSource(destpath='.')

    A generic data source file (file, http, ftp, ...).

    DataSources can be local files or remote files/URLs.  The files may
    also be compressed or uncompressed. DataSource hides some of the
    low-level details of downloading the file, allowing you to simply pass
    in a valid file path (or URL) and obtain a file object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    destpath : str or None, optional
        Path to the directory where the source file gets downloaded to for
        use.  If `destpath` is None, a temporary directory will be created.
        The default path is the current directory.

    Notes
    -----
    URLs require a scheme string (``http://``) to be used, without it they
    will fail::

        >>> repos = DataSource()
        >>> repos.exists('www.google.com/index.html')
        False
        >>> repos.exists('http://www.google.com/index.html')
        True

    Temporary directories are deleted when the DataSource is deleted.

    Examples
    --------
    ::

        >>> ds = DataSource('/home/guido')
        >>> urlname = 'http://www.google.com/index.html'
        >>> gfile = ds.open('http://www.google.com/index.html')  # remote file
        >>> ds.abspath(urlname)
        '/home/guido/www.google.com/site/index.html'

        >>> ds = DataSource(None)  # use with temporary file
        >>> ds.open('/home/guido/foobar.txt')
        <open file '/home/guido.foobar.txt', mode 'r' at 0x91d4430>
        >>> ds.abspath('/home/guido/foobar.txt')
        '/tmp/tmpy4pgsP/home/guido/foobar.txt'

    
        Return absolute path of file in the DataSource directory.

        If `path` is an URL, then `abspath` will return either the location
        the file exists locally or the location it would exist when opened
        using the `open` method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path : str
            Can be a local file or a remote URL.

        Returns
        -------
        out : str
            Complete path, including the `DataSource` destination directory.

        Notes
        -----
        The functionality is based on `os.path.abspath`.

        zipextGzipWrapgz_modebinary_fileSearches for ``path`` and returns full path if found.

        If path is an URL, _findfile will cache a local copy and return the
        path to the cached file.  If path is a local file, _findfile will
        return a path to that local file.

        The search will include possible compressed versions of the file
        and return the first occurrence found.

        os.path.abspath(os.path.join(base, path)).startswith(base)
        Repository.openfilelistA file interface for handling local and remote data files.

The goal of datasource is to abstract some of the file system operations
when dealing with data files so the researcher doesn't have to know all the
low-level details.  Through datasource, a researcher can obtain and use a
file with one function call, regardless of location of the file.

DataSource is meant to augment standard python libraries, not replace them.
It should work seamlessly with standard file IO operations and the os
module.

DataSource files can originate locally or remotely:

- local files : '/home/guido/src/local/data.txt'
- URLs (http, ftp, ...) : 'http://www.scipy.org/not/real/data.txt'

DataSource files can also be compressed or uncompressed.  Currently only
gzip, bz2 and xz are supported.

Example::

    >>> # Create a DataSource, use os.curdir (default) for local storage.
    >>> ds = datasource.DataSource()
    >>>
    >>> # Open a remote file.
    >>> # DataSource downloads the file, stores it locally in:
    >>> #     './www.google.com/index.html'
    >>> # opens the file and returns a file object.
    >>> fp = ds.open('http://www.google.com/index.html')
    >>>
    >>> # Use the file as you normally would
    >>> fp.read()
    >>> fp.close()

    Repository(baseurl, destpath='.')

    A data repository where multiple DataSource's share a base
    URL/directory.

    `Repository` extends `DataSource` by prepending a base URL (or
    directory) to all the files it handles. Use `Repository` when you will
    be working with multiple files from one base URL.  Initialize
    `Repository` with the base URL, then refer to each file by its filename
    only.

    Parameters
    ----------
    baseurl : str
        Path to the local directory or remote location that contains the
        data files.
    destpath : str or None, optional
        Path to the directory where the source file gets downloaded to for
        use.  If `destpath` is None, a temporary directory will be created.
        The default path is the current directory.

    Examples
    --------
    To analyze all files in the repository, do something like this
    (note: this is not self-contained code)::

        >>> repos = np.lib._datasource.Repository('/home/user/data/dir/')
        >>> for filename in filelist:
        ...     fp = repos.open(filename)
        ...     fp.analyze()
        ...     fp.close()

    Similarly you could use a URL for a repository::

        >>> repos = np.lib._datasource.Repository('http://www.xyz.edu/data')

    pardirTextIOWrapper_istmpdestCache the file specified by path.

        Creates a copy of the file in the datasource cache.

        
    Container for different methods to open (un-)compressed files.

    `_FileOpeners` contains a dictionary that holds one method for each
    supported file format. Attribute lookup is implemented in such a way
    that an instance of `_FileOpeners` itself can be indexed with the keys
    of that dictionary. Currently uncompressed files as well as files
    compressed with ``gzip``, ``bz2`` or ``xz`` compression are supported.

    Notes
    -----
    `_file_openers`, an instance of `_FileOpeners`, is made available for
    use in the `_datasource` module.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.lib._datasource._file_openers.keys()
    [None, '.bz2', '.gz', '.xz', '.lzma']
    >>> np.lib._datasource._file_openers['.gz'] is gzip.open
    True

    -------
    boolval : bool
        The boolean representation of `value`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the string is not 'True' or 'False' (case independent)

    Examples
    --------

        Wrapper to strip each member of the output of `method`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        method : function
            Function that takes a single argument and returns a sequence of
            strings.

        Returns
        -------
        wrapped : function
            The result of wrapping `method`. `wrapped` takes a single input
            argument and returns a list of strings that are stripped of
            white-space.

        case_converterLineSplitter.__init___delimited_splitter
    Factory class for function transforming a string into another object
    (int, float).

    After initialization, an instance can be called to transform a string
    into another object. If the string is recognized as representing a
    missing value, a default value is returned.

    Attributes
    ----------
    func : function
        Function used for the conversion.
    default : any
        Default value to return when the input corresponds to a missing
        value.
    type : type
        Type of the output.
    _status : int
        Integer representing the order of the conversion.
    _mapper : sequence of tuples
        Sequence of tuples (dtype, function, default value) to evaluate in
        order.
    _locked : bool
        Holds `locked` parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype_or_func : {None, dtype, function}, optional
        If a `dtype`, specifies the input data type, used to define a basic
        function and a default value for missing data. For example, when
        `dtype` is float, the `func` attribute is set to `float` and the
        default value to `np.nan`.  If a function, this function is used to
        convert a string to another object. In this case, it is recommended
        to give an associated default value as input.
    default : any, optional
        Value to return by default, that is, when the string to be
        converted is flagged as missing. If not given, `StringConverter`
        tries to supply a reasonable default value.
    missing_values : {None, sequence of str}, optional
        ``None`` or sequence of strings indicating a missing value. If ``None``
        then missing values are indicated by empty entries. The default is
        ``None``.
    locked : bool, optional
        Whether the StringConverter should be locked to prevent automatic
        upgrade or not. Default is False.

    
    Unpack a structured data-type by collapsing nested fields and/or fields
    with a shape.

    Note that the field names are lost.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ndtype : dtype
        The datatype to collapse
    flatten_base : bool, optional
       If True, transform a field with a shape into several fields. Default is
       False.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> dt = np.dtype([('name', 'S4'), ('x', float), ('y', float),
    ...                ('block', int, (2, 3))])
    >>> np.lib._iotools.flatten_dtype(dt)
    [dtype('|S4'), dtype('float64'), dtype('float64'), dtype('int32')]
    >>> np.lib._iotools.flatten_dtype(dt, flatten_base=True)
    [dtype('|S4'), dtype('float64'), dtype('float64'), dtype('int32'),
     dtype('int32'), dtype('int32'), dtype('int32'), dtype('int32'),
     dtype('int32')]

    StringConverter._strict_callInvalid booleanConverter is locked and cannot be upgradedeasy_dtype.<locals>.<genexpr>
    Exception raised when an error occurs in a converter for string values.

    nbnamesvalidatednamesnbempty
        Validate a list of strings as field names for a structured array.

        Parameters
        ----------
        names : sequence of str
            Strings to be validated.
        defaultfmt : str, optional
            Default format string, used if validating a given string
            reduces its length to zero.
        nbfields : integer, optional
            Final number of validated names, used to expand or shrink the
            initial list of names.

        Returns
        -------
        validatednames : list of str
            The list of validated field names.

        Notes
        -----
        A `NameValidator` instance can be called directly, which is the
        same as calling `validate`. For examples, see `NameValidator`.

        StringConverter.__init__.<locals>.<lambda>
    Warning issued when a string converter has a problem.

    Notes
    -----
    In `genfromtxt` a `ConversionWarning` is issued if raising exceptions
    is explicitly suppressed with the "invalid_raise" keyword.

    LineSplitter.__call__ù                The input argument `dtype` is neither a function nor a dtype (got '%s' instead)
        Set StringConverter attributes directly.

        Parameters
        ----------
        func : function
            Conversion function.
        default : any, optional
            Value to return by default, that is, when the string to be
            converted is flagged as missing. If not given,
            `StringConverter` tries to supply a reasonable default value.
        testing_value : str, optional
            A string representing a standard input value of the converter.
            This string is used to help defining a reasonable default
            value.
        missing_values : {sequence of str, None}, optional
            Sequence of strings indicating a missing value. If ``None``, then
            the existing `missing_values` are cleared. The default is `''`.
        locked : bool, optional
            Whether the StringConverter should be locked to prevent
            automatic upgrade or not. Default is False.

        Notes
        -----
        `update` takes the same parameters as the constructor of
        `StringConverter`, except that `func` does not accept a `dtype`
        whereas `dtype_or_func` in the constructor does.

        
    Object to validate a list of strings to use as field names.

    The strings are stripped of any non alphanumeric character, and spaces
    are replaced by '_'. During instantiation, the user can define a list
    of names to exclude, as well as a list of invalid characters. Names in
    the exclusion list are appended a '_' character.

    Once an instance has been created, it can be called with a list of
    names, and a list of valid names will be created.  The `__call__`
    method accepts an optional keyword "default" that sets the default name
    in case of ambiguity. By default this is 'f', so that names will
    default to `f0`, `f1`, etc.

    Parameters
    ----------
    excludelist : sequence, optional
        A list of names to exclude. This list is appended to the default
        list ['return', 'file', 'print']. Excluded names are appended an
        underscore: for example, `file` becomes `file_` if supplied.
    deletechars : str, optional
        A string combining invalid characters that must be deleted from the
        names.
    case_sensitive : {True, False, 'upper', 'lower'}, optional
        * If True, field names are case-sensitive.
        * If False or 'upper', field names are converted to upper case.
        * If 'lower', field names are converted to lower case.

        The default value is True.
    replace_space : '_', optional
        Character(s) used in replacement of white spaces.

    Notes
    -----
    Calling an instance of `NameValidator` is the same as calling its
    method `validate`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> validator = np.lib._iotools.NameValidator()
    >>> validator(['file', 'field2', 'with space', 'CaSe'])
    ['file_', 'field2', 'with_space', 'CaSe']

    >>> validator = np.lib._iotools.NameValidator(excludelist=['excl'],
                                                  deletechars='q',
                                                  case_sensitive='False')
    >>> validator(['excl', 'field2', 'no_q', 'with space', 'CaSe'])
    ['excl_', 'field2', 'no_', 'with_space', 'case']

_handyman~!@#$%^&*()-=+~\|]}[{';: /?.>,<defaultexcludelist
        Find the best converter for a given string, and return the result.

        The supplied string `value` is converted by testing different
        converters in order. First the `func` method of the
        `StringConverter` instance is tried, if this fails other available
        converters are tried.  The order in which these other converters
        are tried is determined by the `_status` attribute of the instance.

        Parameters
        ----------
        value : str
            The string to convert.

        Returns
        -------
        out : any
            The result of converting `value` with the appropriate converter.

        StringConverter._getdtype
    Check whether obj behaves like a bytes object.
    StringConverter.iterupgrade_initial_default/home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/lib/_iotools.pynumpy.lib._iotools_defaultfunc
    Returns whether one or several fields of a dtype are nested.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ndtype : dtype
        Data-type of a structured array.

    Raises
    ------
    AttributeError
        If `ndtype` does not have a `names` attribute.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> dt = np.dtype([('name', 'S4'), ('x', float), ('y', float)])
    >>> np.lib._iotools.has_nested_fields(dt)
    False

    Returns the dtype of the input variable.defaultdeletecharsLineSplitter._delimited_splitter
    Upgrade the mapper of a StringConverter by adding a new function and
    its corresponding default.

    The input function (or sequence of functions) and its associated
    default value (if any) is inserted in penultimate position of the
    mapper.  The corresponding type is estimated from the dtype of the
    default value.

    Parameters
    ----------

        Function, or sequence of functions

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import dateutil.parser

    NumPy has the following versioning scheme (numbers given are examples; they
    can be > 9) in principle):

    - Released version: '1.8.0', '1.8.1', etc.
    - Alpha: '1.8.0a1', '1.8.0a2', etc.
    - Beta: '1.8.0b1', '1.8.0b2', etc.
    - Release candidates: '1.8.0rc1', '1.8.0rc2', etc.
    - Development versions: '1.8.0.dev-f1234afa' (git commit hash appended)
    - Development versions after a1: '1.8.0a1.dev-f1234afa',
                                     '1.8.0b2.dev-f1234afa',
                                     '1.8.1rc1.dev-f1234afa', etc.
    - Development versions (no git hash available): '1.8.0.dev-Unknown'

    Comparing needs to be done against a valid version string or other
    `NumpyVersion` instance. Note that all development versions of the same
    (pre-)release compare equal.

The arraypad module contains a group of functions to pad values onto the edges
of an n-dimensional array.


    Append `pad_amt` median values along `axis`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
        Input array of arbitrary shape.
    pad_amt : int
        Amount of padding to append.
    num : int
        Depth into `arr` along `axis` to calculate median.
        Range: [1, `arr.shape[axis]`] or None (entire axis)
    axis : int
        Axis along which to pad `arr`.

    Returns
    -------
    padarr : ndarray
        Output array, with `pad_amt` values appended along `axis`. The
        appended region is the median of the final `num` values along `axis`.

    
    Pad `axis` of `arr` by symmetry.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
        Input array of arbitrary shape.
    pad_amt : tuple of ints, length 2
        Padding to (prepend, append) along `axis`.
    method : str
        Controls method of symmetry; options are 'even' or 'odd'.
    axis : int
        Axis along which to pad `arr`.

    Returns
    -------
    padarr : ndarray
        Output array, with `pad_amt[0]` values prepended and `pad_amt[1]`
        values appended along `axis`. Both regions are padded with symmetric
        values from the original array.

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm DOES pad with repetition, i.e. the edges are repeated.
    For padding without repeated edges, use `mode='reflect'`.

    The modes 'reflect', 'symmetric', and 'wrap' must be padded with a
    single function, lest the indexing tricks in non-integer multiples of the
    original shape would violate repetition in the final iteration.

    slice_tupsym_chunk2_append_edge_prepend_mean_prepend_maxwrap_chunk1wrap_chunk2sym_slicesym_chunk1edge_slice1edge_slice2_append_med
    Pad `axis` of `arr` via wrapping.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
        Input array of arbitrary shape.
    pad_amt : tuple of ints, length 2
        Padding to (prepend, append) along `axis`.
    axis : int
        Axis along which to pad `arr`.

    Returns
    -------
    padarr : ndarray
        Output array, with `pad_amt[0]` values prepended and `pad_amt[1]`
        values appended along `axis`. Both regions are padded wrapped values
        from the opposite end of `axis`.

    Notes
    -----
    This method of padding is also known as 'tile' or 'tiling'.

    The modes 'reflect', 'symmetric', and 'wrap' must be padded with a
    single function, lest the indexing tricks in non-integer multiples of the
    original shape would violate repetition in the final iteration.

    _append_min_append_max.<locals>.<genexpr>
    Create an ndarray of `shape` with increments along specified `axis`

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
        Input array of arbitrary shape.
    shape : tuple of ints
        Shape of desired array. Should be equivalent to `arr.shape` except
        `shape[axis]` which may have any positive value.
    axis : int
        Axis to increment along.
    reverse : bool
        If False, increment in a positive fashion from 1 to `shape[axis]`,
        inclusive. If True, the bounds are the same but the order reversed.

    Returns
    -------

        Output array sized to pad `arr` along `axis`, with linear range from
        1 to `shape[axis]` along specified `axis`.

    Notes
    -----

        Axis along which to pad `arr`.

    Returns
    -------
    padarr : ndarray
        Output array, with `pad_amt` values appended along `axis`. The
        appended region ramps linearly from the edge value to `end`.

    %s keyword not in allowed keywords %s_pad_wrapmean_chunk_prepend_edge
    Pad `axis` of `arr` by reflection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
        Input array of arbitrary shape.
    pad_amt : tuple of ints, length 2
        Padding to (prepend, append) along `axis`.
    method : str
        Controls method of reflection; options are 'even' or 'odd'.
    axis : int
        Axis along which to pad `arr`.

    Returns
    -------
    padarr : ndarray
        Output array, with `pad_amt[0]` values prepended and `pad_amt[1]`
        values appended along `axis`. Both regions are padded with reflected
        values from the original array.

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm does not pad with repetition, i.e. the edges are not
    repeated in the reflection. For that behavior, use `mode='symmetric'`.

    The modes 'reflect', 'symmetric', and 'wrap' must be padded with a
    single function, lest the indexing tricks in non-integer multiples of the
    original shape would violate repetition in the final iteration.

            Padding function, see Notes.
    stat_length : sequence or int, optional
        Used in 'maximum', 'mean', 'median', and 'minimum'.  Number of

        ((before_1, after_1), ... (before_N, after_N)) unique statistic
        lengths for each axis.

        ((before, after),) yields same before and after statistic lengths

        Used in 'constant'.  The values to set the padded values for each
        axis.

        ((before_1, after_1), ... (before_N, after_N)) unique pad constants
        for each axis.

        linear_ramp and that will form the edge of the padded array.

        ((before_1, after_1), ... (before_N, after_N)) unique end values
        for each axis.

        ((before, after),) yields same before and after end values for each
        axis.

        (constant,) or int is a shortcut for before = after = end value for
        all axes.

        Default is 0.
    reflect_type : {'even', 'odd'}, optional
        Used in 'reflect', and 'symmetric'.  The 'even' style is the
        default with an unaltered reflection around the edge value.  For
        the 'odd' style, the extended part of the array is created by
        subtracting the reflected values from two times the edge value.

    Returns
    -------
    pad : ndarray
        Padded array of rank equal to `array` with shape increased
        according to `pad_width`.

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    For an array with rank greater than 1, some of the padding of later
    axes is calculated from padding of previous axes.  This is easiest to
    think about with a rank 2 array where the corners of the padded array
    are calculated by using padded values from the first axis.

    The padding function, if used, should return a rank 1 array equal in
    length to the vector argument with padded values replaced. It has the
    following signature::

        padding_func(vector, iaxis_pad_width, iaxis, kwargs)

    where

        vector : ndarray
            A rank 1 array already padded with zeros.  Padded values are
            vector[:pad_tuple[0]] and vector[-pad_tuple[1]:].
        iaxis_pad_width : tuple
            A 2-tuple of ints, iaxis_pad_width[0] represents the number of
            values padded at the beginning of vector where
            iaxis_pad_width[1] represents the number of values padded at
            the end of vector.
        iaxis : int
            The axis currently being calculated.
        kwargs : dict
            Any keyword arguments the function requires.

    ar1_indices_setdiff1d_dispatcherdtype_reql_begin_to_beginl_end_to_endl_diff
    Calculates `element in test_elements`, broadcasting over `element` only.
    Returns a boolean array of the same shape as `element` that is True
    where an element of `element` is in `test_elements` and False otherwise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    element : array_like
        Input array.
    test_elements : array_like
        The values against which to test each value of `element`.
        This argument is flattened if it is an array or array_like.
        See notes for behavior with non-array-like parameters.
    assume_unique : bool, optional
        If True, the input arrays are both assumed to be unique, which
        can speed up the calculation.  Default is False.
    invert : bool, optional
        If True, the values in the returned array are inverted, as if
        calculating `element not in test_elements`. Default is False.
        ``np.isin(a, b, invert=True)`` is equivalent to (but faster
        than) ``np.invert(np.isin(a, b))``.

    Returns
    -------
    isin : ndarray, bool
        Has the same shape as `element`. The values `element[isin]`
        are in `test_elements`.

    See Also
    --------
    in1d                  : Flattened version of this function.
    numpy.lib.arraysetops : Module with a number of other functions for
                            performing set operations on arrays.

    Notes
    -----

    `isin` is an element-wise function version of the python keyword `in`.
    ``isin(a, b)`` is roughly equivalent to
    ``np.array([item in b for item in a])`` if `a` and `b` are 1-D sequences.

    `element` and `test_elements` are converted to arrays if they are not
    already. If `test_elements` is a set (or other non-sequence collection)
    it will be converted to an object array with one element, rather than an
    array of the values contained in `test_elements`. This is a consequence
    of the `array` constructor's way of handling non-sequence collections.
    Converting the set to a list usually gives the desired behavior.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13.0

    Examples
    --------
    >>> element = 2*np.arange(4).reshape((2, 2))
    >>> element
    array([[0, 2],
           [4, 6]])
    >>> test_elements = [1, 2, 4, 8]
    >>> mask = np.isin(element, test_elements)
    >>> mask
    array([[ False,  True],
           [ True,  False]])
    >>> element[mask]
    array([2, 4])

    The indices of the matched values can be obtained with `nonzero`:

    >>> np.nonzero(mask)
    (array([0, 1]), array([1, 0]))

    The test can also be inverted:

    >>> mask = np.isin(element, test_elements, invert=True)
    >>> mask
    array([[ True, False],
           [ False, True]])
    >>> element[mask]
    array([0, 6])

    Because of how `array` handles sets, the following does not
    work as expected:

    >>> test_set = {1, 2, 4, 8}
    >>> np.isin(element, test_set)
    array([[ False, False],
           [ False, False]])

    Casting the set to a list gives the expected result:

    >>> np.isin(element, list(test_set))
    array([[ False,  True],
           [ True,  False]])
    contains_objectorig_dtypeoptional_indicesint1d_unique_dispatcher
    Test whether each element of a 1-D array is also present in a second array.

    Returns a boolean array the same length as `ar1` that is True
    where an element of `ar1` is in `ar2` and False otherwise.

    We recommend using :func:`isin` instead of `in1d` for new code.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ar1 : (M,) array_like
        Input array.
    ar2 : array_like
        The values against which to test each value of `ar1`.
    assume_unique : bool, optional
        If True, the input arrays are both assumed to be unique, which
        can speed up the calculation.  Default is False.
    invert : bool, optional
        If True, the values in the returned array are inverted (that is,
        False where an element of `ar1` is in `ar2` and True otherwise).
        Default is False. ``np.in1d(a, b, invert=True)`` is equivalent
        to (but is faster than) ``np.invert(in1d(a, b))``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Returns
    -------
    in1d : (M,) ndarray, bool
        The values `ar1[in1d]` are in `ar2`.

    See Also
    --------
    isin                  : Version of this function that preserves the
                            shape of ar1.
    numpy.lib.arraysetops : Module with a number of other functions for
                            performing set operations on arrays.

    Notes
    -----
    `in1d` can be considered as an element-wise function version of the
    python keyword `in`, for 1-D sequences. ``in1d(a, b)`` is roughly
    equivalent to ``np.array([item in b for item in a])``.
    However, this idea fails if `ar2` is a set, or similar (non-sequence)
    container:  As ``ar2`` is converted to an array, in those cases
    ``asarray(ar2)`` is an object array rather than the expected array of
    contained values.

thus calls to argsort().

    Find the unique elements of an array.

    Returns the sorted unique elements of an array. There are three optional
    outputs in addition to the unique elements:

    * the indices of the input array that give the unique values
    * the indices of the unique array that reconstruct the input array
    * the number of times each unique value comes up in the input array

    Parameters
    ----------
    ar : array_like
        Input array. Unless `axis` is specified, this will be flattened if it
        is not already 1-D.
    return_index : bool, optional
        If True, also return the indices of `ar` (along the specified axis,
        if provided, or in the flattened array) that result in the unique array.
    return_inverse : bool, optional
        If True, also return the indices of the unique array (for the specified
        axis, if provided) that can be used to reconstruct `ar`.
    return_counts : bool, optional
        If True, also return the number of times each unique item appears
        in `ar`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    axis : int or None, optional
        The axis to operate on. If None, `ar` will be flattened. If an integer,
        the subarrays indexed by the given axis will be flattened and treated
        as the elements of a 1-D array with the dimension of the given axis,
        see the notes for more details.  Object arrays or structured arrays
        that contain objects are not supported if the `axis` kwarg is used. The
        default is None.

        .. versionadded:: 1.13.0

    Returns
    -------
    unique : ndarray
        The sorted unique values.
    unique_indices : ndarray, optional
        The indices of the first occurrences of the unique values in the
        original array. Only provided if `return_index` is True.
    unique_inverse : ndarray, optional
        The indices to reconstruct the original array from the
        unique array. Only provided if `return_inverse` is True.
    unique_counts : ndarray, optional
        The number of times each of the unique values comes up in the
        original array. Only provided if `return_counts` is True.

    Notes
    -----
    When an axis is specified the subarrays indexed by the axis are sorted.
    This is done by making the specified axis the first dimension of the array
    and then flattening the subarrays in C order. The flattened subarrays are
    then viewed as a structured type with each element given a label, with the
    effect that we end up with a 1-D array of structured types that can be
    treated in the same way as any other 1-D array. The result is that the
    flattened subarrays are sorted in lexicographic order starting with the
    first element.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.unique([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3])
    array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 1], [2, 3]])
    >>> np.unique(a)
    array([1, 2, 3])

    Return the unique rows of a 2D array

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [2, 3, 4]])
    >>> np.unique(a, axis=0)
    array([[1, 0, 0], [2, 3, 4]])

    Return the indices of the original array that give the unique values:

    >>> a = np.array(['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'a'])
    >>> u, indices = np.unique(a, return_index=True)
    >>> u
    array(['a', 'b', 'c'],
           dtype='|S1')
    >>> indices
    array([0, 1, 3])
    >>> a[indices]
    array(['a', 'b', 'c'],
           dtype='|S1')

    Reconstruct the input array from the unique values:

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 6, 4, 2, 3, 2])
    >>> u, indices = np.unique(a, return_inverse=True)
    >>> u
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 6])
    >>> indices
    array([0, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1])

    Buffered iterator for big arrays.

    `Arrayterator` creates a buffered iterator for reading big arrays in small
    contiguous blocks. The class is useful for objects stored in the
    file system. It allows iteration over the object *without* reading
    everything in memory; instead, small blocks are read and iterated over.

    `Arrayterator` can be used with any object that supports multidimensional
    slices. This includes NumPy arrays, but also variables from
    Scientific.IO.NetCDF or pynetcdf for example.

    Parameters
    ----------
    var : array_like
        The object to iterate over.
    buf_size : int, optional
        The buffer size. If `buf_size` is supplied, the maximum amount of
        data that will be read into memory is `buf_size` elements.
        Default is None, which will read as many element as possible
        into memory.

    Attributes
    ----------
    var
    buf_size
    start
    stop
    step
    shape
    flat

    See Also
    --------
    ndenumerate : Multidimensional array iterator.
    flatiter : Flat array iterator.
    memmap : Create a memory-map to an array stored in a binary file on disk.

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm works by first finding a "running dimension", along which
    the blocks will be extracted. Given an array of dimensions
    ``(d1, d2, ..., dn)``, e.g. if `buf_size` is smaller than ``d1``, the
    first dimension will be used. If, on the other hand,
    ``d1 < buf_size < d1*d2`` the second dimension will be used, and so on.
    Blocks are extracted along this dimension, and when the last block is
    returned the process continues from the next dimension, until all
    elements have been read.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(3 * 4 * 5 * 6).reshape(3, 4, 5, 6)
    >>> a_itor = np.lib.Arrayterator(a, 2)
    >>> a_itor.shape
    (3, 4, 5, 6)

    Now we can iterate over ``a_itor``, and it will return arrays of size
    two. Since `buf_size` was smaller than any dimension, the first
    dimension will be iterated over first:

    >>> for subarr in a_itor:
    ...     if not subarr.all():
    ...         print(subarr, subarr.shape)
    ...
    [[[[0 1]]]] (1, 1, 1, 2)

    
        The shape of the array to be iterated over.

        For an example, see `Arrayterator`.

        
A buffered iterator for big arrays.

This module solves the problem of iterating over a big file-based array
without having to read it into memory. The `Arrayterator` class wraps
an array object, and when iterated it will return sub-arrays with at most
a user-specified number of elements.

<module numpy.lib.arrayterator>Arrayterator.flat
        A 1-D flat iterator for Arrayterator objects.

        This iterator returns elements of the array to be iterated over in
        `Arrayterator` one by one. It is similar to `flatiter`.

    Returns the NPV (Net Present Value) of a cash flow series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rate : scalar
        The discount rate.
    values : array_like, shape(M, )
        The values of the time series of cash flows.  The (fixed) time
        interval between cash flow "events" must be the same as that for
        which `rate` is given (i.e., if `rate` is per year, then precisely
        a year is understood to elapse between each cash flow event).  By
        convention, investments or "deposits" are negative, income or
        "withdrawals" are positive; `values` must begin with the initial
        investment, thus `values[0]` will typically be negative.

    Returns
    -------
    out : float
        The NPV of the input cash flow series `values` at the discount
        `rate`.

    _rate_dispatcher
    Return the Internal Rate of Return (IRR).

    This is the "average" periodically compounded rate of return
    that gives a net present value of 0.0; for a more complete explanation,
    see Notes below.

    :class:`decimal.Decimal` type is not supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values : array_like, shape(N,)
        Input cash flows per time period.  By convention, net "deposits"
        are negative and net "withdrawals" are positive.  Thus, for
        example, at least the first element of `values`, which represents
        the initial investment, will typically be negative.

    Returns
    -------
    out : float
        Internal Rate of Return for periodic input values.

    Notes
    -----
    The IRR is perhaps best understood through an example (illustrated
    using np.irr in the Examples section below).  Suppose one invests 100
    units and then makes the following withdrawals at regular (fixed)
    intervals: 39, 59, 55, 20.  Assuming the ending value is 0, one's 100
    unit investment yields 173 units; however, due to the combination of
    compounding and the periodic withdrawals, the "average" rate of return
    is neither simply 0.73/4 nor (1.73)^0.25-1.  Rather, it is the solution
    (for :math:`r`) of the equation:

    .. math:: -100 + \frac{39}{1+r} + \frac{59}{(1+r)^2}
     + \frac{55}{(1+r)^3} + \frac{20}{(1+r)^4} = 0

    In general, for `values` :math:`= [v_0, v_1, ... v_M]`,
    irr is the solution of the equation: [G]_

    .. math:: \sum_{t=0}^M{\frac{v_t}{(1+irr)^{t}}} = 0

     * at the beginning (`when` = {'begin', 1}) or the end
       (`when` = {'end', 0}) of each period

    Return:
       the value at the end of the `nper` periods

    Parameters
    ----------
    rate : scalar or array_like of shape(M, )
        Rate of interest as decimal (not per cent) per period
    nper : scalar or array_like of shape(M, )
        Number of compounding periods
    pmt : scalar or array_like of shape(M, )
        Payment
    pv : scalar or array_like of shape(M, )
        Present value
    when : {{'begin', 1}, {'end', 0}}, {string, int}, optional
        When payments are due ('begin' (1) or 'end' (0)).
        Defaults to {'end', 0}.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Future values.  If all input is scalar, returns a scalar float.  If
        any input is array_like, returns future values for each input element.
        If multiple inputs are array_like, they all must have the same shape.

    Notes
    -----
    The future value is computed by solving the equation::

     fv +
     pv*(1+rate)**nper +
     pmt*(1 + rate*when)/rate*((1 + rate)**nper - 1) == 0

    or, when ``rate == 0``::

     fv + pv + pmt * nper == 0

    Examples
    --------
    What is the future value after 10 years of saving $100 now, with
    an additional monthly savings of $100.  Assume the interest rate is
    5% (annually) compounded monthly?

    >>> np.fv(0.05/12, 10*12, -100, -100)
    15692.928894335748

    By convention, the negative sign represents cash flow out (i.e. money not
    available today).  Thus, saving $100 a month at 5% annual interest leads
    to $15,692.93 available to spend in 10 years.

    If any input is array_like, returns an array of equal shape.  Let's
    compare different interest rates from the example above.

    >>> a = np.array((0.05, 0.06, 0.07))/12
    >>> np.fv(a, 10*12, -100, -100)
    array([ 15692.92889434,  16569.87435405,  17509.44688102])

    
    Compute the interest portion of a payment.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rate : scalar or array_like of shape(M, )
        Rate of interest as decimal (not per cent) per period
    per : scalar or array_like of shape(M, )
        Interest paid against the loan changes during the life or the loan.
        The `per` is the payment period to calculate the interest amount.
    nper : scalar or array_like of shape(M, )
        Number of compounding periods
    pv : scalar or array_like of shape(M, )
        Present value
    fv : scalar or array_like of shape(M, ), optional
        Future value
    when : {{'begin', 1}, {'end', 0}}, {string, int}, optional
        When payments are due ('begin' (1) or 'end' (0)).
        Defaults to {'end', 0}.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Interest portion of payment.  If all input is scalar, returns a scalar
        float.  If any input is array_like, returns interest payment for each
        input element. If multiple inputs are array_like, they all must have
        the same shape.

    ppmt, pmt, pv

    Notes
    -----
    The total payment is made up of payment against principal plus interest.

    ``pmt = ppmt + ipmt``

    Examples
    --------
    What is the amortization schedule for a 1 year loan of $2500 at
    8.24% interest per year compounded monthly?

    >>> principal = 2500.00

    The 'per' variable represents the periods of the loan.  Remember that
    financial equations start the period count at 1!

    >>> per = np.arange(1*12) + 1
    >>> ipmt = np.ipmt(0.0824/12, per, 1*12, principal)
    >>> ppmt = np.ppmt(0.0824/12, per, 1*12, principal)

    Each element of the sum of the 'ipmt' and 'ppmt' arrays should equal
    'pmt'.

    >>> pmt = np.pmt(0.0824/12, 1*12, principal)
    >>> np.allclose(ipmt + ppmt, pmt)
    True

    >>> fmt = '{0:2d} {1:8.2f} {2:8.2f} {3:8.2f}'
    >>> for payment in per:
    ...     index = payment - 1
    ...     principal = principal + ppmt[index]

    Compute the present value.

    Given:
     * a future value, `fv`
     * an interest `rate` compounded once per period, of which
       there are
     * `nper` total
     * a (fixed) payment, `pmt`, paid either
     * at the beginning (`when` = {'begin', 1}) or the end
       (`when` = {'end', 0}) of each period

    Return:
       the value now

    Parameters
    ----------
    rate : array_like
        Rate of interest (per period)
    nper : array_like
        Number of compounding periods
    pmt : array_like
        Payment
    fv : array_like, optional
        Future value
    when : {{'begin', 1}, {'end', 0}}, {string, int}, optional
        When payments are due ('begin' (1) or 'end' (0))

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray, float
        Present value of a series of payments or investments.

    Notes
    -----
    The present value is computed by solving the equation::

     fv +
     pv*(1 + rate)**nper +
     pmt*(1 + rate*when)/rate*((1 + rate)**nper - 1) = 0

    or, when ``rate = 0``::

     fv + pv + pmt * nper = 0

    for `pv`, which is then returned.

    Examples
    --------
    What is the present value (e.g., the initial investment)
    of an investment that needs to total $15692.93
    after 10 years of saving $100 every month?  Assume the
    interest rate is 5% (annually) compounded monthly.

    >>> np.pv(0.05/12, 10*12, -100, 15692.93)
    -100.00067131625819

    By convention, the negative sign represents cash flow out
    (i.e., money not available today).  Thus, to end up with
    $15,692.93 in 10 years saving $100 a month at 5% annual
    interest, one's initial deposit should also be $100.

    If any input is array_like, ``pv`` returns an array of equal shape.
    Let's compare different interest rates in the example above:

    >>> a = np.array((0.05, 0.04, 0.03))/12
    >>> np.pv(a, 10*12, -100, 15692.93)
    array([ -100.00067132,  -649.26771385, -1273.78633713])

    So, to end up with the same $15692.93 under the same $100 per month
    "savings plan," for annual interest rates of 4% and 3%, one would
    need initial investments of $649.27 and $1273.79, respectively.

    
    Compute the number of periodic payments.

    :class:`decimal.Decimal` type is not supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rate : array_like
        Rate of interest (per period)
    pmt : array_like
        Payment
    pv : array_like
        Present value
    fv : array_like, optional
        Future value
    when : {{'begin', 1}, {'end', 0}}, {string, int}, optional
        When payments are due ('begin' (1) or 'end' (0))

    Notes
    -----
    The number of periods ``nper`` is computed by solving the equation::

     fv + pv*(1+rate)**nper + pmt*(1+rate*when)/rate*((1+rate)**nper-1) = 0

    but if ``rate = 0`` then::

     fv + pv + pmt*nper = 0

    Examples
    --------
    If you only had $150/month to pay towards the loan, how long would it take
    to pay-off a loan of $8,000 at 7% annual interest?

    >>> print(round(np.nper(0.07/12, -150, 8000), 5))
    64.07335

    So, over 64 months would be required to pay off the loan.

    The same analysis could be done with several different interest rates
    and/or payments and/or total amounts to produce an entire table.

    >>> np.nper(*(np.ogrid[0.07/12: 0.08/12: 0.01/12,
    ...                    -150   : -99     : 50    ,
    ...                    8000   : 9001    : 1000]))
    array([[[  64.07334877,   74.06368256],
            [ 108.07548412,  127.99022654]],
           [[  66.12443902,   76.87897353],
            [ 114.70165583,  137.90124779]]])

    
    Compute the payment against loan principal plus interest.

    Given:
     * a present value, `pv` (e.g., an amount borrowed)
     * a future value, `fv` (e.g., 0)
     * an interest `rate` compounded once per period, of which
       there are
     * `nper` total
     * and (optional) specification of whether payment is made
       at the beginning (`when` = {'begin', 1}) or the end
       (`when` = {'end', 0}) of each period

    Return:
       the (fixed) periodic payment.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rate : array_like
        Rate of interest (per period)
    nper : array_like
        Number of compounding periods
    pv : array_like
        Present value
    fv : array_like,  optional
        Future value (default = 0)
    when : {{'begin', 1}, {'end', 0}}, {string, int}
        When payments are due ('begin' (1) or 'end' (0))

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Payment against loan plus interest.  If all input is scalar, returns a
        scalar float.  If any input is array_like, returns payment for each
        input element. If multiple inputs are array_like, they all must have
        the same shape.

    Notes
    -----
    The payment is computed by solving the equation::

     fv +
     pv*(1 + rate)**nper +
     pmt*(1 + rate*when)/rate*((1 + rate)**nper - 1) == 0

    or, when ``rate == 0``::

      fv + pv + pmt * nper == 0

    for ``pmt``.

    Note that computing a monthly mortgage payment is only
    one use for this function.  For example, pmt returns the
    periodic deposit one must make to achieve a specified
    future balance given an initial deposit, a fixed,
    periodically compounded interest rate, and the total
    number of periods.

    In order to pay-off (i.e., have a future-value of 0) the $200,000 obtained
    today, a monthly payment of $1,854.02 would be required.  Note that this
    example illustrates usage of `fv` having a default value of 0.

        value) or nan is returned.  The first value is considered a sunk
        cost at time zero.
    finance_rate : scalar

    This function is here to simply have a different name for the 'fv'
    function to not interfere with the 'fv' keyword argument within the 'ipmt'
    function.  It is the 'remaining balance on loan' which might be useful as
    it's own function, but is easily calculated with the 'fv' function.
    Some simple financial calculations

patterned after spreadsheet computations.

There is some complexity in each function
so that the functions behave like ufuncs with
broadcasting and being able to be called with scalars
or arrays (or other sequences).

Functions support the :class:`decimal.Decimal` type unless
otherwise stated.

        This has the appropriate entries for writing its string representation
        to the header of the file.
    version: tuple or None

    Returns
    -------
    version : tuple of int
        the file version which needs to be used to store the data
    generate_tokens
    descr may be stored as dtype.descr, which is a list of
    (name, format, [shape]) tuples where format may be a str or a tuple.
    Offsets are not explicitly saved, rather empty fields with

    Get a serializable descriptor from the dtype.

    The .descr attribute of a dtype object cannot be round-tripped through
    the dtype() constructor. Simple types, like dtype('float32'), have
    a descr which looks like a record array with one field with '' as
    a name. The dtype() constructor interprets this as a request to give
    a default name.  Instead, we construct descriptor that can be passed to
    dtype().

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype : dtype
        The dtype of the array that will be written to disk.

    Returns
    -------
    descr : object
        An object that can be passed to `numpy.dtype()` in order to
        replicate the input dtype.

NPY format
==========

A simple format for saving numpy arrays to disk with the full
information about them.

The ``.npy`` format is the standard binary file format in NumPy for
persisting a *single* arbitrary NumPy array on disk. The format stores all
of the shape and dtype information necessary to reconstruct the array
correctly even on another machine with a different architecture.
The format is designed to be as simple as possible while achieving
its limited goals.

The ``.npz`` format is the standard format for persisting *multiple* NumPy
arrays on disk. A ``.npz`` file is a zip file containing multiple ``.npy``
files, one for each array.

Capabilities
------------

- Can represent all NumPy arrays including nested record arrays and
  object arrays.

- Represents the data in its native binary form.

- Supports Fortran-contiguous arrays directly.

- Stores all of the necessary information to reconstruct the array
  including shape and dtype on a machine of a different
  architecture.  Both little-endian and big-endian arrays are
  supported, and a file with little-endian numbers will yield
  a little-endian array on any machine reading the file. The
  types are described in terms of their actual sizes. For example,
  if a machine with a 64-bit C "long int" writes out an array with
  "long ints", a reading machine with 32-bit C "long ints" will yield
  an array with 64-bit integers.

- Is straightforward to reverse engineer. Datasets often live longer than
  the programs that created them. A competent developer should be
  able to create a solution in their preferred programming language to
  read most ``.npy`` files that he has been given without much
  documentation.

- Allows memory-mapping of the data. See `open_memmep`.

- Can be read from a filelike stream object instead of an actual file.

- Stores object arrays, i.e. arrays containing elements that are arbitrary
  Python objects. Files with object arrays are not to be mmapable, but
  can be read and written to disk.

Limitations
-----------

- Arbitrary subclasses of numpy.ndarray are not completely preserved.
  Subclasses will be accepted for writing, but only the array data will
  be written out. A regular numpy.ndarray object will be created
  upon reading the file.

.. warning::

  Due to limitations in the interpretation of structured dtypes, dtypes
  with fields with empty names will have the names replaced by 'f0', 'f1',
  etc. Such arrays will not round-trip through the format entirely
  accurately. The data is intact; only the field names will differ. We are
  working on a fix for this. This fix will not require a change in the
  file format. The arrays with such structures can still be saved and
  restored, and the correct dtype may be restored by using the
  ``loadedarray.view(correct_dtype)`` method.

File extensions
---------------

We recommend using the ``.npy`` and ``.npz`` extensions for files saved
in this format. This is by no means a requirement; applications may wish
to use these file formats but use an extension specific to the
application. In the absence of an obvious alternative, however,
we suggest using ``.npy`` and ``.npz``.

Version numbering
-----------------

The version numbering of these formats is independent of NumPy version
numbering. If the format is upgraded, the code in `numpy.io` will still
be able to read and write Version 1.0 files.

Format Version 1.0
------------------

The first 6 bytes are a magic string: exactly ``\x93NUMPY``.

The next 1 byte is an unsigned byte: the major version number of the file
format, e.g. ``\x01``.

The next 1 byte is an unsigned byte: the minor version number of the file
format, e.g. ``\x00``. Note: the version of the file format is not tied
to the version of the numpy package.

The next 2 bytes form a little-endian unsigned short int: the length of
the header data HEADER_LEN.

The next HEADER_LEN bytes form the header data describing the array's
format. It is an ASCII string which contains a Python literal expression
of a dictionary. It is terminated by a newline (``\n``) and padded with
spaces (``\x20``) to make the total of
``len(magic string) + 2 + len(length) + HEADER_LEN`` be evenly divisible
by 64 for alignment purposes.

The dictionary contains three keys:

    "descr" : dtype.descr
      An object that can be passed as an argument to the `numpy.dtype`
      constructor to create the array's dtype.
    "fortran_order" : bool
      Whether the array data is Fortran-contiguous or not. Since
      Fortran-contiguous arrays are a common form of non-C-contiguity,
      we allow them to be written directly to disk for efficiency.
    "shape" : tuple of int
      The shape of the array.

For repeatability and readability, the dictionary keys are sorted in
alphabetic order. This is for convenience only. A writer SHOULD implement
this if possible. A reader MUST NOT depend on this.

Following the header comes the array data. If the dtype contains Python
objects (i.e. ``dtype.hasobject is True``), then the data is a Python
pickle of the array. Otherwise the data is the contiguous (either C-
or Fortran-, depending on ``fortran_order``) bytes of the array.
Consumers can figure out the number of bytes by multiplying the number
of elements given by the shape (noting that ``shape=()`` means there is
1 element) by ``dtype.itemsize``.

Format Version 2.0
------------------

The version 1.0 format only allowed the array header to have a total size of
65535 bytes.  This can be exceeded by structured arrays with a large number of
columns.  The version 2.0 format extends the header size to 4 GiB.
`numpy.save` will automatically save in 2.0 format if the data requires it,
else it will always use the more compatible 1.0 format.

The description of the fourth element of the header therefore has become:
"The next 4 bytes form a little-endian unsigned int: the length of the header
data HEADER_LEN."

The ``.npy`` format, including motivation for creating it and a comparison of
alternatives, is described in the `"npy-format" NEP
<https://www.numpy.org/neps/nep-0001-npy-format.html>`_, however details have
evolved with time and this document is more current.

<H
    Write an array to an NPY file, including a header.

    If the array is neither C-contiguous nor Fortran-contiguous AND the
    file_like object is not a real file object, this function will have to
    copy data in memory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fp : file_like object
        An open, writable file object, or similar object with a
        ``.write()`` method.
    array : ndarray
        The array to write to disk.
    version : (int, int) or None, optional
        The version number of the format. None means use the oldest
        supported version that is able to store the data.  Default: None
    allow_pickle : bool, optional
        Whether to allow writing pickled data. Default: True
    pickle_kwargs : dict, optional
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to pickle.dump, excluding
        'protocol'. These are only useful when pickling objects in object
        arrays on Python 3 to Python 2 compatible format.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the array cannot be persisted. This includes the case of
        allow_pickle=False and array being an object array.
    Various other errors
        If the array contains Python objects as part of its dtype, the
        process of pickling them may raise various errors if the objects
        are not picklable.

    This will leave the file object located just after the header.

    .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    fp : filelike object
        A file object or something with a `.read()` method like a file.

        The shape of the array.
    fortran_order : bool
        The array data will be written out directly if it is either
        C-contiguous or Fortran-contiguous. Otherwise, it will be made
        contiguous before writing it out.
    dtype : dtype
        The dtype of the file's data.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the data is invalid.

    '%s': %s,  Write the header for an array using the 2.0 format.
        The 2.0 format allows storing very large structured arrays.

    .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    fp : filelike object
    d : dict
        This has the appropriate entries for writing its string
        representation to the header of the file.
    max_read_count Write the header for an array using the 1.0 format.

    Parameters
    ----------

    Cannot parse header: {!r}
Exception: {!r}Header length %s too big for version=%smajor version must be 0 <= major < 256
    Read from file-like object until size bytes are read.
    Raises ValueError if not EOF is encountered before size bytes are read.
    Non-blocking objects only supported if they derive from io objects.

    Required as e.g. ZipExtFile in python 2.6 can return less data than
    requested.
    descr_to_dtypedescr_to_dtype.<locals>.<genexpr>
    Open a .npy file as a memory-mapped array.

    This may be used to read an existing file or create a new one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str or path-like
        The name of the file on disk.  This may *not* be a file-like
        object.
    mode : str, optional
        The mode in which to open the file; the default is 'r+'.  In
        addition to the standard file modes, 'c' is also accepted to mean
        "copy on write."  See `memmap` for the available mode strings.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The data type of the array if we are creating a new file in "write"
        mode, if not, `dtype` is ignored.  The default value is None, which
        results in a data-type of `float64`.
    shape : tuple of int
        The shape of the array if we are creating a new file in "write"
        mode, in which case this parameter is required.  Otherwise, this
        parameter is ignored and is thus optional.
    fortran_order : bool, optional
        Whether the array should be Fortran-contiguous (True) or
        C-contiguous (False, the default) if we are creating a new file in
        "write" mode.
    version : tuple of int (major, minor) or None
        If the mode is a "write" mode, then this is the version of the file
        format used to create the file.  None means use the oldest
        supported version that is able to store the data.  Default: None

    Returns
    -------
    marray : memmap
        The memory-mapped array.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the data or the mode is invalid.

        A file object or something with a `.read()` method like a file.

    Returns
    -------
    shape : tuple of int
        The shape of the array.
    fortran_order : bool
        The array data will be written out directly if it is either

    Return the Bartlett window.

    The Bartlett window is very similar to a triangular window, except
    that the end points are at zero.  It is often used in signal
    processing for tapering a signal, without generating too much
    ripple in the frequency domain.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : int
        Number of points in the output window. If zero or less, an
        empty array is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    out : array
        The triangular window, with the maximum value normalized to one
        (the value one appears only if the number of samples is odd), with
        the first and last samples equal to zero.

    See Also
    --------
    blackman, hamming, hanning, kaiser

    Notes
    -----
    The Bartlett window is defined as

    .. math:: w(n) = \frac{2}{M-1} \left(
              \frac{M-1}{2} - \left|n - \frac{M-1}{2}\right|
              \right)

    Most references to the Bartlett window come from the signal
    processing literature, where it is used as one of many windowing
    functions for smoothing values.  Note that convolution with this
    window produces linear interpolation.  It is also known as an
    apodization (which means"removing the foot", i.e. smoothing
    discontinuities at the beginning and end of the sampled signal) or
    tapering function. The fourier transform of the Bartlett is the product
    of two sinc functions.
    Note the excellent discussion in Kanasewich.

        Return arrays with the results of `pyfunc` broadcast (vectorized) over
        `args` and `kwargs` not in `excluded`.

    Internal Function.
    Call `func` with `a` as first argument swapping the axes to use extended
    axis on functions that don't support it natively.

    Returns result and a.shape with axis dims set to 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    func : callable
        Reduction function capable of receiving a single axis argument.
        It is called with `a` as first argument followed by `kwargs`.
    kwargs : keyword arguments
        additional keyword arguments to pass to `func`.

    Returns
    -------
    result : tuple
        Result of func(a, **kwargs) and a.shape with axis dims set to 1
        which can be used to reshape the result to the same shape a ufunc with
        keepdims=True would produce.

    using a non-integer array as obj in delete will result in an error in the futurecompiled_interp
    Return a new array with sub-arrays along an axis deleted. For a one
    dimensional array, this returns those entries not returned by
    `arr[obj]`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array_like
      Input array.
    obj : slice, int or array of ints
      Indicate which sub-arrays to remove.
    axis : int, optional
      The axis along which to delete the subarray defined by `obj`.
      If `axis` is None, `obj` is applied to the flattened array.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        A copy of `arr` with the elements specified by `obj` removed. Note
        that `delete` does not occur in-place. If `axis` is None, `out` is
        a flattened array.

    See Also
    --------
    insert : Insert elements into an array.
    append : Append elements at the end of an array.

    Notes
    -----
    Often it is preferable to use a boolean mask. For example:

    >>> mask = np.ones(len(arr), dtype=bool)
    >>> mask[[0,2,4]] = False
    >>> result = arr[mask,...]

    Is equivalent to `np.delete(arr, [0,2,4], axis=0)`, but allows further
    use of `mask`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8], [9,10,11,12]])
    >>> arr
    array([[ 1,  2,  3,  4],
           [ 5,  6,  7,  8],
           [ 9, 10, 11, 12]])
    >>> np.delete(arr, 1, 0)
    array([[ 1,  2,  3,  4],
           [ 9, 10, 11, 12]])

    >>> np.delete(arr, np.s_[::2], 1)
    array([[ 2,  4],
           [ 6,  8],
           [10, 12]])
    >>> np.delete(arr, [1,3,5], None)
    array([ 1,  3,  5,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12])

    Compute the median along the specified axis.

    Returns the median of the array elements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : {int, sequence of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the medians are computed. The default
        is to compute the median along a flattened version of the array.
        A sequence of axes is supported since version 1.9.0.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
        but the type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
       If True, then allow use of memory of input array `a` for
       calculations. The input array will be modified by the call to
       `median`. This will save memory when you do not need to preserve
       the contents of the input array. Treat the input as undefined,
       but it will probably be fully or partially sorted. Default is
       False. If `overwrite_input` is ``True`` and `a` is not already an
       `ndarray`, an error will be raised.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `arr`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Returns
    -------
    median : ndarray
        A new array holding the result. If the input contains integers
        or floats smaller than ``float64``, then the output data-type is
        ``np.float64``.  Otherwise, the data-type of the output is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    See Also
    --------
    mean, percentile

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` of length ``N``, the median of ``V`` is the
    middle value of a sorted copy of ``V``, ``V_sorted`` - i
    e., ``V_sorted[(N-1)/2]``, when ``N`` is odd, and the average of the
    two middle values of ``V_sorted`` when ``N`` is even.

    >>> a = np.array([[10, 7, 4], [3, 2, 1]])
    >>> a

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
        Controls the memory layout of the copy. 'C' means C-order,
        'F' means F-order, 'A' means 'F' if `a` is Fortran contiguous,
        'C' otherwise. 'K' means match the layout of `a` as closely
        as possible. (Note that this function and :meth:`ndarray.copy` are very
        similar, but have different default values for their order=
        arguments.)

    Returns
    -------
    arr : ndarray
        Array interpretation of `a`.

    Notes
    -----
    This is equivalent to:

    >>> np.array(a, copy=True)  #doctest: +SKIP

    Examples
    --------
    Create an array x, with a reference y and a copy z:

    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> y = x
    >>> z = np.copy(x)

    Note that, when we modify x, y changes, but not z:

    >>> x[0] = 10
    >>> x[0] == y[0]
    True
    >>> x[0] == z[0]
    False

    Ház®Gá?num_core_dims
    Return the sinc function.

    The sinc function is :math:`\sin(\pi x)/(\pi x)`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray
        Array (possibly multi-dimensional) of values for which to to
        calculate ``sinc(x)``.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        ``sinc(x)``, which has the same shape as the input.

    Notes
    -----
    ``sinc(0)`` is the limit value 1.

    The name sinc is short for "sine cardinal" or "sinus cardinalis".

    The sinc function is used in various signal processing applications,
    including in anti-aliasing, in the construction of a Lanczos resampling
    filter, and in interpolation.

    For bandlimited interpolation of discrete-time signals, the ideal
    interpolation kernel is proportional to the sinc function.

    Return the gradient of an N-dimensional array.

    The gradient is computed using second order accurate central differences
    in the interior points and either first or second order accurate one-sides
    (forward or backwards) differences at the boundaries.
    The returned gradient hence has the same shape as the input array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : array_like
        An N-dimensional array containing samples of a scalar function.
    varargs : list of scalar or array, optional
        Spacing between f values. Default unitary spacing for all dimensions.
        Spacing can be specified using:

        1. single scalar to specify a sample distance for all dimensions.
        2. N scalars to specify a constant sample distance for each dimension.
           i.e. `dx`, `dy`, `dz`, ...
        3. N arrays to specify the coordinates of the values along each
           dimension of F. The length of the array must match the size of
           the corresponding dimension
        4. Any combination of N scalars/arrays with the meaning of 2. and 3.

        If `axis` is given, the number of varargs must equal the number of axes.
        Default: 1.

    edge_order : {1, 2}, optional
        Gradient is calculated using N-th order accurate differences
        at the boundaries. Default: 1.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.1

    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Gradient is calculated only along the given axis or axes
        The default (axis = None) is to calculate the gradient for all the axes
        of the input array. axis may be negative, in which case it counts from
        the last to the first axis.

        .. versionadded:: 1.11.0

    Returns
    -------
    gradient : ndarray or list of ndarray
        A set of ndarrays (or a single ndarray if there is only one dimension)
        corresponding to the derivatives of f with respect to each dimension.
        Each derivative has the same shape as f.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> f = np.array([1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16], dtype=float)
    >>> np.gradient(f)
    array([ 1. ,  1.5,  2.5,  3.5,  4.5,  5. ])
    >>> np.gradient(f, 2)
    array([ 0.5 ,  0.75,  1.25,  1.75,  2.25,  2.5 ])

    Spacing can be also specified with an array that represents the coordinates
    of the values F along the dimensions.
    For instance a uniform spacing:

    >>> x = np.arange(f.size)
    >>> np.gradient(f, x)
    array([ 1. ,  1.5,  2.5,  3.5,  4.5,  5. ])

    Or a non uniform one:

    >>> x = np.array([0., 1., 1.5, 3.5, 4., 6.], dtype=float)
    >>> np.gradient(f, x)
    array([ 1. ,  3. ,  3.5,  6.7,  6.9,  2.5])

    For two dimensional arrays, the return will be two arrays ordered by
    axis. In this example the first array stands for the gradient in
    rows and the second one in columns direction:

    >>> np.gradient(np.array([[1, 2, 6], [3, 4, 5]], dtype=float))
    [array([[ 2.,  2., -1.],
            [ 2.,  2., -1.]]), array([[ 1. ,  2.5,  4. ],
            [ 1. ,  1. ,  1. ]])]

    In this example the spacing is also specified:
    uniform for axis=0 and non uniform for axis=1

    >>> dx = 2.
    >>> y = [1., 1.5, 3.5]
    >>> np.gradient(np.array([[1, 2, 6], [3, 4, 5]], dtype=float), dx, y)
    [array([[ 1. ,  1. , -0.5],
            [ 1. ,  1. , -0.5]]), array([[ 2. ,  2. ,  2. ],
            [ 2. ,  1.7,  0.5]])]

    It is possible to specify how boundaries are treated using `edge_order`

    >>> x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> f = x**2
    >>> np.gradient(f, edge_order=1)
    array([ 1.,  2.,  4.,  6.,  7.])
    >>> np.gradient(f, edge_order=2)
    array([-0.,  2.,  4.,  6.,  8.])

    The `axis` keyword can be used to specify a subset of axes of which the
    gradient is calculated

    >>> np.gradient(np.array([[1, 2, 6], [3, 4, 5]], dtype=float), axis=0)
    array([[ 2.,  2., -1.],
           [ 2.,  2., -1.]])

    Notes
    -----
    Assuming that :math:`f\in C^{3}` (i.e., :math:`f` has at least 3 continuous
    derivatives) and let :math:`h_{*}` be a non-homogeneous stepsize, we
    minimize the "consistency error" :math:`\eta_{i}` between the true gradient
    and its estimate from a linear combination of the neighboring grid-points:

    .. math::

        \eta_{i} = f_{i}^{\left(1\right)} -
                    \left[ \alpha f\left(x_{i}\right) +
                            \beta f\left(x_{i} + h_{d}\right) +
                            \gamma f\left(x_{i}-h_{s}\right)
                    \right]

    By substituting :math:`f(x_{i} + h_{d})` and :math:`f(x_{i} - h_{s})`
    with their Taylor series expansion, this translates into solving
    the following the linear system:

    .. math::

        \left\{
            \begin{array}{r}
                \alpha+\beta+\gamma=0 \\
                \beta h_{d}-\gamma h_{s}=1 \\
                \beta h_{d}^{2}+\gamma h_{s}^{2}=0
            \end{array}
        \right.

    The resulting approximation of :math:`f_{i}^{(1)}` is the following:

    .. math::

        \hat f_{i}^{(1)} =
            \frac{
                h_{s}^{2}f\left(x_{i} + h_{d}\right)
                + \left(h_{d}^{2} - h_{s}^{2}\right)f\left(x_{i}\right)
                - h_{d}^{2}f\left(x_{i}-h_{s}\right)}
                { h_{s}h_{d}\left(h_{d} + h_{s}\right)}
            + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{h_{d}h_{s}^{2}
                                + h_{s}h_{d}^{2}}{h_{d}
                                + h_{s}}\right)

    It is worth noting that if :math:`h_{s}=h_{d}`
    (i.e., data are evenly spaced)
    we find the standard second order approximation:

    .. math::

        \hat f_{i}^{(1)}=
            \frac{f\left(x_{i+1}\right) - f\left(x_{i-1}\right)}{2h}
            + \mathcal{O}\left(h^{2}\right)

    With a similar procedure the forward/backward approximations used for
    boundaries can be derived.

    Display a message on a device.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesg : str
        Message to display.
    device : object
        Device to write message. If None, defaults to ``sys.stdout`` which is
        very similar to ``print``. `device` needs to have ``write()`` and
        ``flush()`` methods.
    linefeed : bool, optional
        Option whether to print a line feed or not. Defaults to True.

    Raises
    ------
    AttributeError
        If `device` does not have a ``write()`` or ``flush()`` method.

    Examples
    --------
    Besides ``sys.stdout``, a file-like object can also be used as it has
    both required methods:

    >>> from io import StringIO
    >>> buf = StringIO()
    >>> np.disp(u'"Display" in a file', device=buf)

    Compute the weighted average along the specified axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing data to be averaged. If `a` is not an array, a
        conversion is attempted.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which to average `a`.  The default,
        axis=None, will average over all of the elements of the input array.
        If axis is negative it counts from the last to the first axis.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If axis is a tuple of ints, averaging is performed on all of the axes
        specified in the tuple instead of a single axis or all the axes as
        before.
    weights : array_like, optional
        An array of weights associated with the values in `a`. Each value in
        `a` contributes to the average according to its associated weight.
        The weights array can either be 1-D (in which case its length must be
        the size of `a` along the given axis) or of the same shape as `a`.
        If `weights=None`, then all data in `a` are assumed to have a
        weight equal to one.
    returned : bool, optional
        Default is `False`. If `True`, the tuple (`average`, `sum_of_weights`)
        is returned, otherwise only the average is returned.
        If `weights=None`, `sum_of_weights` is equivalent to the number of
        elements over which the average is taken.


    Returns
    -------
    retval, [sum_of_weights] : array_type or double
        Return the average along the specified axis. When `returned` is `True`,
        return a tuple with the average as the first element and the sum
        of the weights as the second element. `sum_of_weights` is of the
        same type as `retval`. The result dtype follows a genereal pattern.
        If `weights` is None, the result dtype will be that of `a` , or ``float64``
        if `a` is integral. Otherwise, if `weights` is not None and `a` is non-
        integral, the result type will be the type of lowest precision capable of
        representing values of both `a` and `weights`. If `a` happens to be
        integral, the previous rules still applies but the result dtype will
        at least be ``float64``.

    Raises
    ------
    ZeroDivisionError
        When all weights along axis are zero. See `numpy.ma.average` for a
        version robust to this type of error.
    TypeError
        When the length of 1D `weights` is not the same as the shape of `a`
        along axis.

    Return the Kaiser window.

    The Kaiser window is a taper formed by using a Bessel function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : int
        Number of points in the output window. If zero or less, an
        empty array is returned.
    beta : float
        Shape parameter for window.

    Returns
    -------
    out : array
        The window, with the maximum value normalized to one (the value
        one appears only if the number of samples is odd).

    See Also
    --------
    bartlett, blackman, hamming, hanning

    Notes
    -----
    The Kaiser window is defined as

    .. math::  w(n) = I_0\left( \beta \sqrt{1-\frac{4n^2}{(M-1)^2}}
               \right)/I_0(\beta)

    with

    .. math:: \quad -\frac{M-1}{2} \leq n \leq \frac{M-1}{2},

    where :math:`I_0` is the modified zeroth-order Bessel function.

    The Kaiser was named for Jim Kaiser, who discovered a simple
    approximation to the DPSS window based on Bessel functions.  The Kaiser
    window is a very good approximation to the Digital Prolate Spheroidal
    Sequence, or Slepian window, which is the transform which maximizes the
    energy in the main lobe of the window relative to total energy.

    The Kaiser can approximate many other windows by varying the beta
    parameter.

    ====  =======================
    beta  Window shape
    ====  =======================
    0     Rectangular
    5     Similar to a Hamming
    6     Similar to a Hanning
    8.6   Similar to a Blackman
    ====  =======================

    A beta value of 14 is probably a good starting point. Note that as beta
    gets large, the window narrows, and so the number of samples needs to be
    large enough to sample the increasingly narrow spike, otherwise NaNs will
    get returned.

    Most references to the Kaiser window come from the signal processing
    literature, where it is used as one of many windowing functions for
    smoothing values.  It is also known as an apodization (which means
    "removing the foot", i.e. smoothing discontinuities at the beginning
    and end of the sampled signal) or tapering function.

    Return the Blackman window.

    The Blackman window is a taper formed by using the first three
    terms of a summation of cosines. It was designed to have close to the
    minimal leakage possible.  It is close to optimal, only slightly worse
    than a Kaiser window.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : int
        Number of points in the output window. If zero or less, an empty
        array is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The window, with the maximum value normalized to one (the value one
        appears only if the number of samples is odd).

    Notes
    -----
    The Blackman window is defined as

    .. math::  w(n) = 0.42 - 0.5 \cos(2\pi n/M) + 0.08 \cos(4\pi n/M)

    Most references to the Blackman window come from the signal processing
    literature, where it is used as one of many windowing functions for
    smoothing values.  It is also known as an apodization (which means
    "removing the foot", i.e. smoothing discontinuities at the beginning
    and end of the sampled signal) or tapering function. It is known as a
    "near optimal" tapering function, almost as good (by some measures)
    as the kaiser window.

    Return the Hanning window.

    The Hanning window is a taper formed by using a weighted cosine.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : int
        Number of points in the output window. If zero or less, an
        empty array is returned.

    Returns
    -------

        The window, with the maximum value normalized to one (the value
        one appears only if `M` is odd).

    See Also

    Notes
    -----
    The Hanning window is defined as

    .. math::  w(n) = 0.5 - 0.5cos\left(\frac{2\pi{n}}{M-1}\right)
               \qquad 0 \leq n \leq M-1

    The Hanning was named for Julius von Hann, an Austrian meteorologist.
    It is also known as the Cosine Bell. Some authors prefer that it be
    called a Hann window, to help avoid confusion with the very similar
    Hamming window.

    Most references to the Hanning window come from the signal processing
    literature, where it is used as one of many windowing functions for
    smoothing values.  It is also known as an apodization (which means
    "removing the foot", i.e. smoothing discontinuities at the beginning
    and end of the sampled signal) or tapering function.

    Compute the q-th percentile of the data along the specified axis.

    Returns the q-th percentile(s) of the array elements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    q : array_like of float
        Percentile or sequence of percentiles to compute, which must be between
        0 and 100 inclusive.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the percentiles are computed. The
        default is to compute the percentile(s) along a flattened
        version of the array.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.9.0
            A tuple of axes is supported
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
        but the type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
        If True, then allow the input array `a` to be modified by intermediate
        calculations, to save memory. In this case, the contents of the input
        `a` after this function completes is undefined.

    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to
        use when the desired percentile lies between two data points
        ``i < j``:

        * 'linear': ``i + (j - i) * fraction``, where ``fraction``
          is the fractional part of the index surrounded by ``i``
          and ``j``.
        * 'lower': ``i``.
        * 'higher': ``j``.
        * 'nearest': ``i`` or ``j``, whichever is nearest.
        * 'midpoint': ``(i + j) / 2``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in
        the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the
        result will broadcast correctly against the original array `a`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Returns
    -------
    percentile : scalar or ndarray
        If `q` is a single percentile and `axis=None`, then the result
        is a scalar. If multiple percentiles are given, first axis of
        the result corresponds to the percentiles. The other axes are
        the axes that remain after the reduction of `a`. If the input
        contains integers or floats smaller than ``float64``, the output
        data-type is ``float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    See Also
    --------
    mean
    median : equivalent to ``percentile(..., 50)``
    nanpercentile
    quantile : equivalent to percentile, except with q in the range [0, 1].

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` of length ``N``, the q-th percentile of
    ``V`` is the value ``q/100`` of the way from the minimum to the
    maximum in a sorted copy of ``V``. The values and distances of
    the two nearest neighbors as well as the `interpolation` parameter
    will determine the percentile if the normalized ranking does not
    match the location of ``q`` exactly. This function is the same as
    the median if ``q=50``, the same as the minimum if ``q=0`` and the
    same as the maximum if ``q=100``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[10, 7, 4], [3, 2, 1]])
    >>> a
    array([[10,  7,  4],
           [ 3,  2,  1]])
    >>> np.percentile(a, 50)
    3.5
    >>> np.percentile(a, 50, axis=0)
    array([[ 6.5,  4.5,  2.5]])
    >>> np.percentile(a, 50, axis=1)
    array([ 7.,  2.])
    >>> np.percentile(a, 50, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    array([[ 7.],
           [ 2.]])

    >>> m = np.percentile(a, 50, axis=0)
    >>> out = np.zeros_like(m)
    >>> np.percentile(a, 50, axis=0, out=out)
    array([[ 6.5,  4.5,  2.5]])
    >>> m
    array([[ 6.5,  4.5,  2.5]])

    >>> b = a.copy()
    >>> np.percentile(b, 50, axis=1, overwrite_input=True)
    array([ 7.,  2.])
    >>> assert not np.all(a == b)

    The different types of interpolation can be visualized graphically:

    Insert values along the given axis before the given indices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array_like
        Input array.
    obj : int, slice or sequence of ints
        Object that defines the index or indices before which `values` is
        inserted.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

        Support for multiple insertions when `obj` is a single scalar or a
        sequence with one element (similar to calling insert multiple
        times).
    values : array_like
        Values to insert into `arr`. If the type of `values` is different
        from that of `arr`, `values` is converted to the type of `arr`.
        `values` should be shaped so that ``arr[...,obj,...] = values``
        is legal.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to insert `values`.  If `axis` is None then `arr`
        is flattened first.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        A copy of `arr` with `values` inserted.  Note that `insert`
        does not occur in-place: a new array is returned. If
        `axis` is None, `out` is a flattened array.

    See Also
    --------
    append : Append elements at the end of an array.
    concatenate : Join a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.
    delete : Delete elements from an array.

    Notes
    -----
    Note that for higher dimensional inserts `obj=0` behaves very different
    from `obj=[0]` just like `arr[:,0,:] = values` is different from
    `arr[:,[0],:] = values`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]])
    >>> a

    array([ 1.+2.j,  2.-1.j,  3.-3.j,  3.-2.j,  3.+5.j])

    
    Return the indices of the bins to which each value in input array belongs.

    =========  =============  ============================
    `right`    order of bins  returned index `i` satisfies
    =========  =============  ============================
    ``False``  increasing     ``bins[i-1] <= x < bins[i]``
    ``True``   increasing     ``bins[i-1] < x <= bins[i]``
    ``False``  decreasing     ``bins[i-1] > x >= bins[i]``
    ``True``   decreasing     ``bins[i-1] >= x > bins[i]``
    =========  =============  ============================

    If values in `x` are beyond the bounds of `bins`, 0 or ``len(bins)`` is
    returned as appropriate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array to be binned. Prior to NumPy 1.10.0, this array had to
        be 1-dimensional, but can now have any shape.
    bins : array_like
        Array of bins. It has to be 1-dimensional and monotonic.
    right : bool, optional
        Indicating whether the intervals include the right or the left bin
        edge. Default behavior is (right==False) indicating that the interval
        does not include the right edge. The left bin end is open in this
        case, i.e., bins[i-1] <= x < bins[i] is the default behavior for
        monotonically increasing bins.

    Returns
    -------
    indices : ndarray of ints
        Output array of indices, of same shape as `x`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `bins` is not monotonic.
    TypeError
        If the type of the input is complex.

    See Also
    --------
    bincount, histogram, unique, searchsorted

    Notes
    -----
    If values in `x` are such that they fall outside the bin range,
    attempting to index `bins` with the indices that `digitize` returns
    will result in an IndexError.

    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    `np.digitize` is  implemented in terms of `np.searchsorted`. This means
    that a binary search is used to bin the values, which scales much better
    for larger number of bins than the previous linear search. It also removes
    the requirement for the input array to be 1-dimensional.

    For monotonically _increasing_ `bins`, the following are equivalent::

        np.digitize(x, bins, right=True)
        np.searchsorted(bins, x, side='left')

    Note that as the order of the arguments are reversed, the side must be too.
    The `searchsorted` call is marginally faster, as it does not do any
    monotonicity checks. Perhaps more importantly, it supports all dtypes.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([0.2, 6.4, 3.0, 1.6])
    >>> bins = np.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.5, 4.0, 10.0])
    >>> inds = np.digitize(x, bins)
    >>> inds
    array([1, 4, 3, 2])
    >>> for n in range(x.size):
    ...   print(bins[inds[n]-1], "<=", x[n], "<", bins[inds[n]])
    ...
    0.0 <= 0.2 < 1.0
    4.0 <= 6.4 < 10.0
    2.5 <= 3.0 < 4.0
    1.0 <= 1.6 < 2.5

    >>> x = np.array([1.2, 10.0, 12.4, 15.5, 20.])
    >>> bins = np.array([0, 5, 10, 15, 20])
    >>> np.digitize(x,bins,right=True)
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 4])
    >>> np.digitize(x,bins,right=False)
    array([1, 3, 3, 4, 5])
    condelse
    Unwrap by changing deltas between values to 2*pi complement.

    Unwrap radian phase `p` by changing absolute jumps greater than
    `discont` to their 2*pi complement along the given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : array_like
        Input array.
    discont : float, optional
        Maximum discontinuity between values, default is ``pi``.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which unwrap will operate, default is the last axis.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Output array.

    --------
    rad2deg, deg2rad

    Notes
    -----
    If the discontinuity in `p` is smaller than ``pi``, but larger than
    `discont`, no unwrapping is done because taking the 2*pi complement
    would only make the discontinuity larger.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> phase = np.linspace(0, np.pi, num=5)
    >>> phase[3:] += np.pi
    >>> phase

    Modified Bessel function of the first kind, order 0.

    Usually denoted :math:`I_0`.  This function does broadcast, but will *not*
    "up-cast" int dtype arguments unless accompanied by at least one float or
    complex dtype argument (see Raises below).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, dtype float or complex
        Argument of the Bessel function.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray, shape = x.shape, dtype = x.dtype
        The modified Bessel function evaluated at each of the elements of `x`.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError: array cannot be safely cast to required type
        If argument consists exclusively of int dtypes.

    We use the algorithm published by Clenshaw [1]_ and referenced by
    Abramowitz and Stegun [2]_, for which the function domain is
    partitioned into the two intervals [0,8] and (8,inf), and Chebyshev
    polynomial expansions are employed in each interval. Relative error on
    the domain [0,30] using IEEE arithmetic is documented [3]_ as having a
    peak of 5.8e-16 with an rms of 1.4e-16 (n = 30000).

    Return the elements of an array that satisfy some condition.

    This is equivalent to ``np.compress(ravel(condition), ravel(arr))``.  If
    `condition` is boolean ``np.extract`` is equivalent to ``arr[condition]``.

    Note that `place` does the exact opposite of `extract`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    condition : array_like
        An array whose nonzero or True entries indicate the elements of `arr`
        to extract.
    arr : array_like
        Input array of the same size as `condition`.

    Returns
    -------
    extract : ndarray
        Rank 1 array of values from `arr` where `condition` is True.

    Return coordinate matrices from coordinate vectors.

    Make N-D coordinate arrays for vectorized evaluations of
    N-D scalar/vector fields over N-D grids, given
    one-dimensional coordinate arrays x1, x2,..., xn.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.9
       1-D and 0-D cases are allowed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1, x2,..., xn : array_like
        1-D arrays representing the coordinates of a grid.
    indexing : {'xy', 'ij'}, optional
        Cartesian ('xy', default) or matrix ('ij') indexing of output.
        See Notes for more details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
    sparse : bool, optional
        If True a sparse grid is returned in order to conserve memory.
        Default is False.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
    copy : bool, optional
        If False, a view into the original arrays are returned in order to
        conserve memory.  Default is True.  Please note that
        ``sparse=False, copy=False`` will likely return non-contiguous
        arrays.  Furthermore, more than one element of a broadcast array
        may refer to a single memory location.  If you need to write to the
        arrays, make copies first.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    X1, X2,..., XN : ndarray
        For vectors `x1`, `x2`,..., 'xn' with lengths ``Ni=len(xi)`` ,
        return ``(N1, N2, N3,...Nn)`` shaped arrays if indexing='ij'
        or ``(N2, N1, N3,...Nn)`` shaped arrays if indexing='xy'
        with the elements of `xi` repeated to fill the matrix along
        the first dimension for `x1`, the second for `x2` and so on.

    Notes
    -----
    This function supports both indexing conventions through the indexing
    keyword argument.  Giving the string 'ij' returns a meshgrid with
    matrix indexing, while 'xy' returns a meshgrid with Cartesian indexing.
    In the 2-D case with inputs of length M and N, the outputs are of shape
    (N, M) for 'xy' indexing and (M, N) for 'ij' indexing.  In the 3-D case
    with inputs of length M, N and P, outputs are of shape (N, M, P) for
    'xy' indexing and (M, N, P) for 'ij' indexing.  The difference is
    illustrated by the following code snippet::

        xv, yv = np.meshgrid(x, y, sparse=False, indexing='ij')
        for i in range(nx):
            for j in range(ny):
                # treat xv[i,j], yv[i,j]

        xv, yv = np.meshgrid(x, y, sparse=False, indexing='xy')
        for i in range(nx):
            for j in range(ny):
                # treat xv[j,i], yv[j,i]

    In the 1-D and 0-D case, the indexing and sparse keywords have no effect.

    {®Gáz´?_cov_dispatcher_trim_zerosHelper for creating output arrays in vectorize.
    Estimate a covariance matrix, given data and weights.

    Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
    If we examine N-dimensional samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]^T`,
    then the covariance matrix element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of
    :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`. The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance
    of :math:`x_i`.

    See the notes for an outline of the algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : array_like
        A 1-D or 2-D array containing multiple variables and observations.
        Each row of `m` represents a variable, and each column a single
        observation of all those variables. Also see `rowvar` below.
    y : array_like, optional
        An additional set of variables and observations. `y` has the same form
        as that of `m`.
    rowvar : bool, optional
        If `rowvar` is True (default), then each row represents a
        variable, with observations in the columns. Otherwise, the relationship
        is transposed: each column represents a variable, while the rows
        contain observations.
    bias : bool, optional
        Default normalization (False) is by ``(N - 1)``, where ``N`` is the
        number of observations given (unbiased estimate). If `bias` is True,
        then normalization is by ``N``. These values can be overridden by using
        the keyword ``ddof`` in numpy versions >= 1.5.
    ddof : int, optional
        If not ``None`` the default value implied by `bias` is overridden.
        Note that ``ddof=1`` will return the unbiased estimate, even if both
        `fweights` and `aweights` are specified, and ``ddof=0`` will return
        the simple average. See the notes for the details. The default value
        is ``None``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5
    fweights : array_like, int, optional
        1-D array of integer frequency weights; the number of times each
        observation vector should be repeated.

        .. versionadded:: 1.10
    aweights : array_like, optional
        1-D array of observation vector weights. These relative weights are
        typically large for observations considered "important" and smaller for
        observations considered less "important". If ``ddof=0`` the array of
        weights can be used to assign probabilities to observation vectors.

        .. versionadded:: 1.10

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The covariance matrix of the variables.

    See Also
    --------
    corrcoef : Normalized covariance matrix

    Notes
    -----
    Assume that the observations are in the columns of the observation
    array `m` and let ``f = fweights`` and ``a = aweights`` for brevity. The
    steps to compute the weighted covariance are as follows::

        >>> w = f * a
        >>> v1 = np.sum(w)
        >>> v2 = np.sum(w * a)
        >>> m -= np.sum(m * w, axis=1, keepdims=True) / v1
        >>> cov = np.dot(m * w, m.T) * v1 / (v1**2 - ddof * v2)

    Note that when ``a == 1``, the normalization factor
    ``v1 / (v1**2 - ddof * v2)`` goes over to ``1 / (np.sum(f) - ddof)``
    as it should.

    Examples
    --------
    Consider two variables, :math:`x_0` and :math:`x_1`, which
    correlate perfectly, but in opposite directions:

    >>> x = np.array([[0, 2], [1, 1], [2, 0]]).T
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [2, 1, 0]])

    Note how :math:`x_0` increases while :math:`x_1` decreases. The covariance
    matrix shows this clearly:

    >>> np.cov(x)
    array([[ 1., -1.],
           [-1.,  1.]])

    Note that element :math:`C_{0,1}`, which shows the correlation between
    :math:`x_0` and :math:`x_1`, is negative.

    Further, note how `x` and `y` are combined:

    >>> x = [-2.1, -1,  4.3]
    >>> y = [3,  1.1,  0.12]
    >>> X = np.stack((x, y), axis=0)
    >>> print(np.cov(X))
    [[ 11.71        -4.286     ]
     [ -4.286        2.14413333]]
    >>> print(np.cov(x, y))
    [[ 11.71        -4.286     ]
     [ -4.286        2.14413333]]
    >>> print(np.cov(x))
    11.71

    _ARGUMENT_LIST
    Append values to the end of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array_like
        Values are appended to a copy of this array.
    values : array_like
        These values are appended to a copy of `arr`.  It must be of the
        correct shape (the same shape as `arr`, excluding `axis`).  If
        `axis` is not specified, `values` can be any shape and will be
        flattened before use.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which `values` are appended.  If `axis` is not
        given, both `arr` and `values` are flattened before use.

    Returns
    -------
    append : ndarray
        A copy of `arr` with `values` appended to `axis`.  Note that
        `append` does not occur in-place: a new array is allocated and
        filled.  If `axis` is None, `out` is a flattened array.

    --------
    insert : Insert elements into an array.
    delete : Delete elements from an array.

    When `axis` is specified, `values` must have the correct shape.

    Calculate the n-th discrete difference along the given axis.

    The first difference is given by ``out[n] = a[n+1] - a[n]`` along
    the given axis, higher differences are calculated by using `diff`
    recursively.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array
    n : int, optional
        The number of times values are differenced. If zero, the input
        is returned as-is.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which the difference is taken, default is the
        last axis.
    prepend, append : array_like, optional
        Values to prepend or append to "a" along axis prior to
        performing the difference.  Scalar values are expanded to
        arrays with length 1 in the direction of axis and the shape
        of the input array in along all other axes.  Otherwise the
        dimension and shape must match "a" except along axis.

    Returns
    -------
    diff : ndarray
        The n-th differences. The shape of the output is the same as `a`
        except along `axis` where the dimension is smaller by `n`. The
        type of the output is the same as the type of the difference
        between any two elements of `a`. This is the same as the type of
        `a` in most cases. A notable exception is `datetime64`, which
        results in a `timedelta64` output array.

    See Also
    --------
    gradient, ediff1d, cumsum

    Notes
    -----
    Type is preserved for boolean arrays, so the result will contain
    `False` when consecutive elements are the same and `True` when they
    differ.

    For unsigned integer arrays, the results will also be unsigned. This
    should not be surprising, as the result is consistent with
    calculating the difference directly:

    >>> u8_arr = np.array([1, 0], dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> np.diff(u8_arr)
    array([255], dtype=uint8)
    >>> u8_arr[1,...] - u8_arr[0,...]
    array(255, np.uint8)

    If this is not desirable, then the array should be cast to a larger
    integer type first:

    >>> i16_arr = u8_arr.astype(np.int16)
    >>> np.diff(i16_arr)
    array([-1], dtype=int16)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 4, 7, 0])
    >>> np.diff(x)
    array([ 1,  2,  3, -7])
    >>> np.diff(x, n=2)
    array([  1,   1, -10])

    >>> x = np.array([[1, 3, 6, 10], [0, 5, 6, 8]])
    >>> np.diff(x)
    array([[2, 3, 4],
           [5, 1, 2]])

    vectorize._get_ufunc_and_otypes
    Compute the q-th quantile of the data along the specified axis.
    ..versionadded:: 1.15.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    q : array_like of float
        Quantile or sequence of quantiles to compute, which must be between
        0 and 1 inclusive.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the quantiles are computed. The
        default is to compute the quantile(s) along a flattened
        version of the array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
        but the type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
        If True, then allow the input array `a` to be modified by intermediate
        calculations, to save memory. In this case, the contents of the input
        `a` after this function completes is undefined.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to
        use when the desired quantile lies between two data points
        ``i < j``:

            * linear: ``i + (j - i) * fraction``, where ``fraction``
              is the fractional part of the index surrounded by ``i``
              and ``j``.
            * lower: ``i``.
            * higher: ``j``.
            * nearest: ``i`` or ``j``, whichever is nearest.
            * midpoint: ``(i + j) / 2``.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in
        the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the
        result will broadcast correctly against the original array `a`.

    Returns
    -------
    quantile : scalar or ndarray
        If `q` is a single quantile and `axis=None`, then the result
        is a scalar. If multiple quantiles are given, first axis of
        the result corresponds to the quantiles. The other axes are
        the axes that remain after the reduction of `a`. If the input
        contains integers or floats smaller than ``float64``, the output
        data-type is ``float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    See Also
    --------
    mean
    percentile : equivalent to quantile, but with q in the range [0, 100].
    median : equivalent to ``quantile(..., 0.5)``
    nanquantile

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` of length ``N``, the q-th quantile of
    ``V`` is the value ``q`` of the way from the minimum to the
    maximum in a sorted copy of ``V``. The values and distances of
    the two nearest neighbors as well as the `interpolation` parameter
    will determine the quantile if the normalized ranking does not
    match the location of ``q`` exactly. This function is the same as
    the median if ``q=0.5``, the same as the minimum if ``q=0.0`` and the
    same as the maximum if ``q=1.0``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[10, 7, 4], [3, 2, 1]])
    >>> a
    array([[10,  7,  4],

    Evaluate a piecewise-defined function.

    Given a set of conditions and corresponding functions, evaluate each
    function on the input data wherever its condition is true.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray or scalar
        The input domain.
    condlist : list of bool arrays or bool scalars
        Each boolean array corresponds to a function in `funclist`.  Wherever
        `condlist[i]` is True, `funclist[i](x)` is used as the output value.

        Each boolean array in `condlist` selects a piece of `x`,
        and should therefore be of the same shape as `x`.

        The length of `condlist` must correspond to that of `funclist`.
        If one extra function is given, i.e. if
        ``len(funclist) == len(condlist) + 1``, then that extra function
        is the default value, used wherever all conditions are false.
    funclist : list of callables, f(x,*args,**kw), or scalars
        Each function is evaluated over `x` wherever its corresponding
        condition is True.  It should take a 1d array as input and give an 1d
        array or a scalar value as output.  If, instead of a callable,
        a scalar is provided then a constant function (``lambda x: scalar``) is
        assumed.
    args : tuple, optional
        Any further arguments given to `piecewise` are passed to the functions
        upon execution, i.e., if called ``piecewise(..., ..., 1, 'a')``, then
        each function is called as ``f(x, 1, 'a')``.
    kw : dict, optional
        Keyword arguments used in calling `piecewise` are passed to the
        functions upon execution, i.e., if called
        ``piecewise(..., ..., alpha=1)``, then each function is called as
        ``f(x, alpha=1)``.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The output is the same shape and type as x and is found by
        calling the functions in `funclist` on the appropriate portions of `x`,
        as defined by the boolean arrays in `condlist`.  Portions not covered
        by any condition have a default value of 0.


    See Also
    --------
    choose, select, where

    Notes
    -----
    This is similar to choose or select, except that functions are
    evaluated on elements of `x` that satisfy the corresponding condition from
    `condlist`.

    The result is::

            |--
            |funclist[0](x[condlist[0]])
      out = |funclist[1](x[condlist[1]])
            |...
            |funclist[n2](x[condlist[n2]])
            |--

    Examples
    --------
    Define the sigma function, which is -1 for ``x < 0`` and +1 for ``x >= 0``.

    >>> x = np.linspace(-2.5, 2.5, 6)
    >>> np.piecewise(x, [x < 0, x >= 0], [-1, 1])
    array([-1., -1., -1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])

    Define the absolute value, which is ``-x`` for ``x <0`` and ``x`` for
    ``x >= 0``.

    >>> np.piecewise(x, [x < 0, x >= 0], [lambda x: -x, lambda x: x])
    array([ 2.5,  1.5,  0.5,  0.5,  1.5,  2.5])

    Apply the same function to a scalar value.

    >>> y = -2
    >>> np.piecewise(y, [y < 0, y >= 0], [lambda x: -x, lambda x: x])
    array(2)

    deprecated_ints_meshgrid_dispatcher
    Reverse the order of elements in an array along the given axis.

    The shape of the array is preserved, but the elements are reordered.

    .. versionadded:: 1.12.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
         Axis or axes along which to flip over. The default,
         axis=None, will flip over all of the axes of the input array.
         If axis is negative it counts from the last to the first axis.

         If axis is a tuple of ints, flipping is performed on all of the axes
         specified in the tuple.

         .. versionchanged:: 1.15.0
            None and tuples of axes are supported

    Returns
    -------
    out : array_like
        A view of `m` with the entries of axis reversed.  Since a view is
        returned, this operation is done in constant time.

    See Also
    --------
    flipud : Flip an array vertically (axis=0).
    fliplr : Flip an array horizontally (axis=1).

    Notes
    -----
    flip(m, 0) is equivalent to flipud(m).

    flip(m, 1) is equivalent to fliplr(m).

    flip(m, n) corresponds to ``m[...,::-1,...]`` with ``::-1`` at position n.

    flip(m) corresponds to ``m[::-1,::-1,...,::-1]`` with ``::-1`` at all
    positions.

    flip(m, (0, 1)) corresponds to ``m[::-1,::-1,...]`` with ``::-1`` at
    position 0 and position 1.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> A = np.arange(8).reshape((2,2,2))
    >>> A

    rot90(m, k=1, axes=(1,0)) is the reverse of rot90(m, k=1, axes=(0,1))
    rot90(m, k=1, axes=(1,0)) is equivalent to rot90(m, k=-1, axes=(0,1))

    Change elements of an array based on conditional and input values.

    Similar to ``np.copyto(arr, vals, where=mask)``, the difference is that
    `place` uses the first N elements of `vals`, where N is the number of
    True values in `mask`, while `copyto` uses the elements where `mask`
    is True.

    Note that `extract` does the exact opposite of `place`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
        Array to put data into.
    mask : array_like
        Boolean mask array. Must have the same size as `a`.
    vals : 1-D sequence
        Values to put into `a`. Only the first N elements are used, where
        N is the number of True values in `mask`. If `vals` is smaller
        than N, it will be repeated, and if elements of `a` are to be masked,
        this sequence must be non-empty.

    Return an array drawn from elements in choicelist, depending on conditions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    condlist : list of bool ndarrays
        The list of conditions which determine from which array in `choicelist`
        the output elements are taken. When multiple conditions are satisfied,
        the first one encountered in `condlist` is used.
    choicelist : list of ndarrays
        The list of arrays from which the output elements are taken. It has
        to be of the same length as `condlist`.
    default : scalar, optional
        The element inserted in `output` when all conditions evaluate to False.

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        The output at position m is the m-th element of the array in
        `choicelist` where the m-th element of the corresponding array in
        `condlist` is True.

    _diff_dispatcher
    vectorize(pyfunc, otypes=None, doc=None, excluded=None, cache=False,
              signature=None)

    Generalized function class.

    Define a vectorized function which takes a nested sequence of objects or
    numpy arrays as inputs and returns a single numpy array or a tuple of numpy
    arrays. The vectorized function evaluates `pyfunc` over successive tuples
    of the input arrays like the python map function, except it uses the
    broadcasting rules of numpy.

    The data type of the output of `vectorized` is determined by calling
    the function with the first element of the input.  This can be avoided
    by specifying the `otypes` argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pyfunc : callable
        A python function or method.
    otypes : str or list of dtypes, optional
        The output data type. It must be specified as either a string of
        typecode characters or a list of data type specifiers. There should
        be one data type specifier for each output.
    doc : str, optional
        The docstring for the function. If `None`, the docstring will be the
        ``pyfunc.__doc__``.
    excluded : set, optional
        Set of strings or integers representing the positional or keyword
        arguments for which the function will not be vectorized.  These will be
        passed directly to `pyfunc` unmodified.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    cache : bool, optional
       If `True`, then cache the first function call that determines the number
       of outputs if `otypes` is not provided.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    signature : string, optional
        Generalized universal function signature, e.g., ``(m,n),(n)->(m)`` for
        vectorized matrix-vector multiplication. If provided, ``pyfunc`` will
        be called with (and expected to return) arrays with shapes given by the
        size of corresponding core dimensions. By default, ``pyfunc`` is
        assumed to take scalars as input and output.

        .. versionadded:: 1.12.0

    Returns
    -------
    vectorized : callable
        Vectorized function.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> def myfunc(a, b):
    ...     "Return a-b if a>b, otherwise return a+b"
    ...     if a > b:
    ...         return a - b
    ...     else:
    ...         return a + b

    >>> vfunc = np.vectorize(myfunc)
    >>> vfunc([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
    array([3, 4, 1, 2])

    The docstring is taken from the input function to `vectorize` unless it
    is specified:

    >>> vfunc.__doc__
    'Return a-b if a>b, otherwise return a+b'
    >>> vfunc = np.vectorize(myfunc, doc='Vectorized `myfunc`')
    >>> vfunc.__doc__
    'Vectorized `myfunc`'

    The output type is determined by evaluating the first element of the input,
    unless it is specified:

    >>> out = vfunc([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
    >>> type(out[0])
    <type 'numpy.int32'>
    >>> vfunc = np.vectorize(myfunc, otypes=[float])
    >>> out = vfunc([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
    >>> type(out[0])
    <type 'numpy.float64'>

    The `excluded` argument can be used to prevent vectorizing over certain
    arguments.  This can be useful for array-like arguments of a fixed length
    such as the coefficients for a polynomial as in `polyval`:

    >>> def mypolyval(p, x):
    ...     _p = list(p)
    ...     res = _p.pop(0)
    ...     while _p:
    ...         res = res*x + _p.pop(0)
    ...     return res
    >>> vpolyval = np.vectorize(mypolyval, excluded=['p'])
    >>> vpolyval(p=[1, 2, 3], x=[0, 1])
    array([3, 6])

    Positional arguments may also be excluded by specifying their position:

    >>> vpolyval.excluded.add(0)
    >>> vpolyval([1, 2, 3], x=[0, 1])
    array([3, 6])

    The `signature` argument allows for vectorizing functions that act on
    non-scalar arrays of fixed length. For example, you can use it for a
    vectorized calculation of Pearson correlation coefficient and its p-value:

    >>> import scipy.stats
    >>> pearsonr = np.vectorize(scipy.stats.pearsonr,
    ...                         signature='(n),(n)->(),()')
    >>> pearsonr([[0, 1, 2, 3]], [[1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 3, 2, 1]])
    (array([ 1., -1.]), array([ 0.,  0.]))

    Or for a vectorized convolution:

    >>> convolve = np.vectorize(np.convolve, signature='(n),(m)->(k)')
    >>> convolve(np.eye(4), [1, 2, 1])
    array([[ 1.,  2.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  1.,  2.,  1.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0.,  1.,  2.,  1.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  1.,  2.,  1.]])

    --------
    frompyfunc : Takes an arbitrary Python function and returns a ufunc

    Notes
    -----
    The `vectorize` function is provided primarily for convenience, not for
    performance. The implementation is essentially a for loop.

    If `otypes` is not specified, then a call to the function with the
    first argument will be used to determine the number of outputs.  The
    results of this call will be cached if `cache` is `True` to prevent
    calling the function twice.  However, to implement the cache, the
    original function must be wrapped which will slow down subsequent
    calls, so only do this if your function is expensive.

    The new keyword argument interface and `excluded` argument support
    further degrades performance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data, in any form that can be converted to an array.  This
        includes lists, lists of tuples, tuples, tuples of tuples, tuples
        of lists and ndarrays.  Success requires no NaNs or Infs.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        By default, the data-type is inferred from the input data.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
         Whether to use row-major (C-style) or
         column-major (Fortran-style) memory representation.
         Defaults to 'C'.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array interpretation of `a`.  No copy is performed if the input
        is already an ndarray.  If `a` is a subclass of ndarray, a base
        class ndarray is returned.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raises ValueError if `a` contains NaN (Not a Number) or Inf (Infinity).

    --------
    asarray : Create and array.
    asanyarray : Similar function which passes through subclasses.
    ascontiguousarray : Convert input to a contiguous array.
    asfarray : Convert input to a floating point ndarray.
    asfortranarray : Convert input to an ndarray with column-major
                     memory order.
    fromiter : Create an array from an iterator.
    fromfunction : Construct an array by executing a function on grid
                   positions.

    Examples
    --------
    Convert a list into an array.  If all elements are finite
    ``asarray_chkfinite`` is identical to ``asarray``.

    >>> a = [1, 2]
    >>> np.asarray_chkfinite(a, dtype=float)
    array([1., 2.])

    Raises ValueError if array_like contains Nans or Infs.

    >>> a = [1, 2, np.inf]
    >>> try:
    ...     np.asarray_chkfinite(a)
    ... except ValueError:

    Return Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients.

    Please refer to the documentation for `cov` for more detail.  The
    relationship between the correlation coefficient matrix, `R`, and the
    covariance matrix, `C`, is

    .. math:: R_{ij} = \frac{ C_{ij} } { \sqrt{ C_{ii} * C_{jj} } }

    The values of `R` are between -1 and 1, inclusive.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        A 1-D or 2-D array containing multiple variables and observations.
        Each row of `x` represents a variable, and each column a single
        observation of all those variables. Also see `rowvar` below.
    y : array_like, optional
        An additional set of variables and observations. `y` has the same
        shape as `x`.
    rowvar : bool, optional
        If `rowvar` is True (default), then each row represents a
        variable, with observations in the columns. Otherwise, the relationship
        is transposed: each column represents a variable, while the rows
        contain observations.
    bias : _NoValue, optional
        Has no effect, do not use.

        .. deprecated:: 1.10.0
    ddof : _NoValue, optional
        Has no effect, do not use.

        .. deprecated:: 1.10.0

    Returns
    -------
    R : ndarray
        The correlation coefficient matrix of the variables.

    See Also
    --------
    cov : Covariance matrix

    Notes
    -----
    Due to floating point rounding the resulting array may not be Hermitian,
    the diagonal elements may not be 1, and the elements may not satisfy the
    inequality abs(a) <= 1. The real and imaginary parts are clipped to the
    interval [-1,  1] in an attempt to improve on that situation but is not
    much help in the complex case.

    This function accepts but discards arguments `bias` and `ddof`.  This is
    for backwards compatibility with previous versions of this function.  These
    arguments had no effect on the return values of the function and can be
    safely ignored in this and previous versions of numpy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array to be sorted.

    Returns
    -------
    sorted_array : ndarray
        Array of the same type and shape as `a`.

    See Also
    --------

    Notes
    -----
    ``np.msort(a)`` is equivalent to  ``np.sort(a, axis=0)``.

    cannot handle multidimensional fweights
    One-dimensional linear interpolation.

    Returns the one-dimensional piecewise linear interpolant to a function
    with given discrete data points (`xp`, `fp`), evaluated at `x`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The x-coordinates at which to evaluate the interpolated values.

    xp : 1-D sequence of floats
        The x-coordinates of the data points, must be increasing if argument
        `period` is not specified. Otherwise, `xp` is internally sorted after
        normalizing the periodic boundaries with ``xp = xp % period``.

    fp : 1-D sequence of float or complex
        The y-coordinates of the data points, same length as `xp`.

    left : optional float or complex corresponding to fp
        Value to return for `x < xp[0]`, default is `fp[0]`.

    right : optional float or complex corresponding to fp
        Value to return for `x > xp[-1]`, default is `fp[-1]`.

    period : None or float, optional
        A period for the x-coordinates. This parameter allows the proper
        interpolation of angular x-coordinates. Parameters `left` and `right`
        are ignored if `period` is specified.

        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    Returns
    -------
    y : float or complex (corresponding to fp) or ndarray
        The interpolated values, same shape as `x`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `xp` and `fp` have different length
        If `xp` or `fp` are not 1-D sequences
        If `period == 0`

    Notes
    -----
    Does not check that the x-coordinate sequence `xp` is increasing.
    If `xp` is not increasing, the results are nonsense.
    A simple check for increasing is::

        np.all(np.diff(xp) > 0)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> xp = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> fp = [3, 2, 0]
    >>> np.interp(2.5, xp, fp)
    1.0
    >>> np.interp([0, 1, 1.5, 2.72, 3.14], xp, fp)
    array([ 3. ,  3. ,  2.5 ,  0.56,  0. ])
    >>> UNDEF = -99.0
    >>> np.interp(3.14, xp, fp, right=UNDEF)
    -99.0

    Plot an interpolant to the sine function:

    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 10)
    >>> y = np.sin(x)
    >>> xvals = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 50)
    >>> yinterp = np.interp(xvals, x, y)
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> plt.plot(x, y, 'o')
    [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x...>]
    >>> plt.plot(xvals, yinterp, '-x')
    [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x...>]
    >>> plt.show()

    Interpolation with periodic x-coordinates:

    >>> x = [-180, -170, -185, 185, -10, -5, 0, 365]
    >>> xp = [190, -190, 350, -350]
    >>> fp = [5, 10, 3, 4]
    >>> np.interp(x, xp, fp, period=360)
    array([7.5, 5., 8.75, 6.25, 3., 3.25, 3.5, 3.75])

    Complex interpolation:

    >>> x = [1.5, 4.0]
    >>> xp = [2,3,5]
    >>> fp = [1.0j, 0, 2+3j]
    >>> np.interp(x, xp, fp)
    array([ 0.+1.j ,  1.+1.5j])

    Returns
    -------

    >>> np.trim_zeros(a, 'b')
    array([0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1])

    The input data type is preserved, list/tuple in means list/tuple out.

    Return the Hamming window.

    The Hamming window is a taper formed by using a weighted cosine.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : int
        Number of points in the output window. If zero or less, an
        empty array is returned.

    Returns
    -------

    Notes
    -----
    The Hamming window is defined as

    .. math::  w(n) = 0.54 - 0.46cos\left(\frac{2\pi{n}}{M-1}\right)
               \qquad 0 \leq n \leq M-1

    The Hamming was named for R. W. Hamming, an associate of J. W. Tukey
    and is described in Blackman and Tukey. It was recommended for
    smoothing the truncated autocovariance function in the time domain.
    Most references to the Hamming window come from the signal processing
    literature, where it is used as one of many windowing functions for
    smoothing values.  It is also known as an apodization (which means
    "removing the foot", i.e. smoothing discontinuities at the beginning
    and end of the sampled signal) or tapering function.

    Histogram bin estimator that uses the minimum width of the
    Freedman-Diaconis and Sturges estimators if the FD bandwidth is non zero
    and the Sturges estimator if the FD bandwidth is 0.

    The FD estimator is usually the most robust method, but its width
    estimate tends to be too large for small `x` and bad for data with limited
    variance. The Sturges estimator is quite good for small (<1000) datasets
    and is the default in the R language. This method gives good off the shelf
    behaviour.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.15.0
    If there is limited variance the IQR can be 0, which results in the
    FD bin width being 0 too. This is not a valid bin width, so
    ``np.histogram_bin_edges`` chooses 1 bin instead, which may not be optimal.
    If the IQR is 0, it's unlikely any variance based estimators will be of
    use, so we revert to the sturges estimator, which only uses the size of the
    dataset in its calculation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input data that is to be histogrammed, trimmed to range. May not
        be empty.

    Returns
    -------

    The Freedman-Diaconis histogram bin estimator.

    The Freedman-Diaconis rule uses interquartile range (IQR) to
    estimate binwidth. It is considered a variation of the Scott rule
    with more robustness as the IQR is less affected by outliers than
    the standard deviation. However, the IQR depends on fewer points
    than the standard deviation, so it is less accurate, especially for
    long tailed distributions.

    If the IQR is 0, this function returns 1 for the number of bins.
    Binwidth is inversely proportional to the cube root of data size
    (asymptotically optimal).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input data that is to be histogrammed, trimmed to range. May not
        be empty.

    Returns
    -------
    h : An estimate of the optimal bin width for the given data.
    `bins` must be positive, when an integer_hist_bin_doanesupplied range of [{}, {}] is not finitePassing `normed=True` on non-uniform bins has always been broken, and computes neither the probability density function nor the probability mass function. The result is only correct if the bins are uniform, when density=True will produce the same result anyway. The argument will be removed in a future version of numpy._ravel_and_check_weightslast_edge
    Scott histogram bin estimator.

    The binwidth is proportional to the standard deviation of the data

    Histogram bin estimator based on minimizing the estimated integrated squared error (ISE).

    The number of bins is chosen by minimizing the estimated ISE against the unknown true distribution.
    The ISE is estimated using cross-validation and can be regarded as a generalization of Scott's rule.

    This paper by Stone appears to be the origination of this rule.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input data that is to be histogrammed, trimmed to range. May not
        be empty.
    range : (float, float)
        The lower and upper range of the bins.

    Returns
    -------
    h : An estimate of the optimal bin width for the given data.
    The number of bins estimated may be suboptimal.

    Rice histogram bin estimator.

    Another simple estimator with no normality assumption. It has better
    performance for large data than Sturges, but tends to overestimate
    the number of bins. The number of bins is proportional to the cube
    root of data size (asymptotically optimal). The estimate depends
    only on size of the data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input data that is to be histogrammed, trimmed to range. May not
        be empty.

    Returns

    Sturges histogram bin estimator.

    A very simplistic estimator based on the assumption of normality of

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input data that is to be histogrammed, trimmed to range. May not
        be empty.

    Returns

    Compute the multidimensional histogram of some data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample : (N, D) array, or (D, N) array_like
        The data to be histogrammed.

        Note the unusual interpretation of sample when an array_like:

        * When an array, each row is a coordinate in a D-dimensional space -
          such as ``histogramgramdd(np.array([p1, p2, p3]))``.
        * When an array_like, each element is the list of values for single
          coordinate - such as ``histogramgramdd((X, Y, Z))``.

        The first form should be preferred.

    bins : sequence or int, optional
        The bin specification:

        * A sequence of arrays describing the monotonically increasing bin
          edges along each dimension.
        * The number of bins for each dimension (nx, ny, ... =bins)
        * The number of bins for all dimensions (nx=ny=...=bins).

    range : sequence, optional
        A sequence of length D, each an optional (lower, upper) tuple giving
        the outer bin edges to be used if the edges are not given explicitly in
        `bins`.
        An entry of None in the sequence results in the minimum and maximum
        values being used for the corresponding dimension.
        The default, None, is equivalent to passing a tuple of D None values.
    density : bool, optional
        If False, the default, returns the number of samples in each bin.
        If True, returns the probability *density* function at the bin,
        ``bin_count / sample_count / bin_volume``.
    normed : bool, optional
        An alias for the density argument that behaves identically. To avoid
        confusion with the broken normed argument to `histogram`, `density`
        should be preferred.
    weights : (N,) array_like, optional
        An array of values `w_i` weighing each sample `(x_i, y_i, z_i, ...)`.
        Weights are normalized to 1 if normed is True. If normed is False,
        the values of the returned histogram are equal to the sum of the
        weights belonging to the samples falling into each bin.

    Returns
    -------
    H : ndarray
        The multidimensional histogram of sample x. See normed and weights
        for the different possible semantics.
    edges : list
        A list of D arrays describing the bin edges for each dimension.

    _hist_bin_sqrtConverting input from {} to {} for compatibility.histogramdd.<locals>.<genexpr><module numpy.lib.histograms>Internal Shape Error
    Function to calculate only the edges of the bins used by the `histogram` function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data. The histogram is computed over the flattened array.
    bins : int or sequence of scalars or str, optional
        If `bins` is an int, it defines the number of equal-width
        bins in the given range (10, by default). If `bins` is a
        sequence, it defines the bin edges, including the rightmost
        edge, allowing for non-uniform bin widths.

        If `bins` is a string from the list below, `histogram_bin_edges` will use
        the method chosen to calculate the optimal bin width and
        consequently the number of bins (see `Notes` for more detail on
        the estimators) from the data that falls within the requested
        range. While the bin width will be optimal for the actual data
        in the range, the number of bins will be computed to fill the
        entire range, including the empty portions. For visualisation,
        using the 'auto' option is suggested. Weighted data is not
        supported for automated bin size selection.

        'auto'
            Maximum of the 'sturges' and 'fd' estimators. Provides good
            all around performance.

        'fd' (Freedman Diaconis Estimator)
            Robust (resilient to outliers) estimator that takes into
            account data variability and data size.

        'doane'
            An improved version of Sturges' estimator that works better
            with non-normal datasets.

        'scott'
            Less robust estimator that that takes into account data
            variability and data size.

        'stone'
            Estimator based on leave-one-out cross-validation estimate of
            the integrated squared error. Can be regarded as a generalization
            of Scott's rule.

        'rice'
            Estimator does not take variability into account, only data
            size. Commonly overestimates number of bins required.

        'sturges'
            R's default method, only accounts for data size. Only
            optimal for gaussian data and underestimates number of bins
            for large non-gaussian datasets.

        'sqrt'
            Square root (of data size) estimator, used by Excel and
            other programs for its speed and simplicity.

    range : (float, float), optional
        The lower and upper range of the bins.  If not provided, range
        is simply ``(a.min(), a.max())``.  Values outside the range are
        ignored. The first element of the range must be less than or
        equal to the second. `range` affects the automatic bin
        computation as well. While bin width is computed to be optimal
        based on the actual data within `range`, the bin count will fill
        the entire range including portions containing no data.

    weights : array_like, optional
        An array of weights, of the same shape as `a`.  Each value in
        `a` only contributes its associated weight towards the bin count
        (instead of 1). This is currently not used by any of the bin estimators,
        but may be in the future.

    Returns
    -------
    bin_edges : array of dtype float
        The edges to pass into `histogram`

    See Also
    --------
    histogram

    Notes
    -----
    The methods to estimate the optimal number of bins are well founded
    in literature, and are inspired by the choices R provides for
    histogram visualisation. Note that having the number of bins
    proportional to :math:`n^{1/3}` is asymptotically optimal, which is
    why it appears in most estimators. These are simply plug-in methods
    that give good starting points for number of bins. In the equations
    below, :math:`h` is the binwidth and :math:`n_h` is the number of
    bins. All estimators that compute bin counts are recast to bin width
    using the `ptp` of the data. The final bin count is obtained from
    ``np.round(np.ceil(range / h))``.

    'Auto' (maximum of the 'Sturges' and 'FD' estimators)
        A compromise to get a good value. For small datasets the Sturges
        value will usually be chosen, while larger datasets will usually
        default to FD.  Avoids the overly conservative behaviour of FD
        and Sturges for small and large datasets respectively.
        Switchover point is usually :math:`a.size \approx 1000`.

    'FD' (Freedman Diaconis Estimator)
        .. math:: h = 2 \frac{IQR}{n^{1/3}}

        The binwidth is proportional to the interquartile range (IQR)
        and inversely proportional to cube root of a.size. Can be too
        conservative for small datasets, but is quite good for large
        datasets. The IQR is very robust to outliers.

    'Scott'
        .. math:: h = \sigma \sqrt[3]{\frac{24 * \sqrt{\pi}}{n}}

        The binwidth is proportional to the standard deviation of the
        data and inversely proportional to cube root of ``x.size``. Can
        be too conservative for small datasets, but is quite good for
        large datasets. The standard deviation is not very robust to
        outliers. Values are very similar to the Freedman-Diaconis
        estimator in the absence of outliers.

    'Rice'
        .. math:: n_h = 2n^{1/3}

        The number of bins is only proportional to cube root of
        ``a.size``. It tends to overestimate the number of bins and it
        does not take into account data variability.

    'Sturges'
        .. math:: n_h = \log _{2}n+1

        The number of bins is the base 2 log of ``a.size``.  This
        estimator assumes normality of data and is too conservative for
        larger, non-normal datasets. This is the default method in R's
        ``hist`` method.

    'Doane'
        .. math:: n_h = 1 + \log_{2}(n) +
                        \log_{2}(1 + \frac{|g_1|}{\sigma_{g_1}})

            g_1 = mean[(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma})^3]

            \sigma_{g_1} = \sqrt{\frac{6(n - 2)}{(n + 1)(n + 3)}}

        An improved version of Sturges' formula that produces better
        estimates for non-normal datasets. This estimator attempts to
        account for the skew of the data.

    'Sqrt'
        .. math:: n_h = \sqrt n
        The simplest and fastest estimator. Only takes into account the
        data size.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> arr = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5])
    >>> np.histogram_bin_edges(arr, bins='auto', range=(0, 1))
    array([0.  , 0.25, 0.5 , 0.75, 1.  ])
    >>> np.histogram_bin_edges(arr, bins=2)
    array([0. , 2.5, 5. ])

    For consistency with histogram, an array of pre-computed bins is
    passed through unmodified:

    >>> np.histogram_bin_edges(arr, [1, 2])
    array([1, 2])

    This function allows one set of bins to be computed, and reused across
    multiple histograms:

    >>> shared_bins = np.histogram_bin_edges(arr, bins='auto')
    >>> shared_bins
    array([0., 1., 2., 3., 4., 5.])

    >>> group_id = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1])
    >>> hist_0, _ = np.histogram(arr[group_id == 0], bins=shared_bins)
    >>> hist_1, _ = np.histogram(arr[group_id == 1], bins=shared_bins)

    >>> hist_0; hist_1
    array([1, 1, 0, 1, 0])
    array([2, 0, 1, 1, 2])

    Which gives more easily comparable results than using separate bins for
    each histogram:

    >>> hist_0, bins_0 = np.histogram(arr[group_id == 0], bins='auto')
    >>> hist_1, bins_1 = np.histogram(arr[group_id == 1], bins='auto')
    >>> hist_0; hist1
    array([1, 1, 1])
    array([2, 1, 1, 2])
    >>> bins_0; bins_1
    array([0., 1., 2., 3.])
    array([0.  , 1.25, 2.5 , 3.75, 5.  ])

    `bins` must increase monotonically, when an arrayThe normed argument is ignored when density is provided. In future passing both will result in an error.`bins[{}]` must be a scalar or 1d array{!r} is not a valid estimator for `bins`_range
    Compute the histogram of a set of data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data. The histogram is computed over the flattened array.
    bins : int or sequence of scalars or str, optional
        If `bins` is an int, it defines the number of equal-width
        bins in the given range (10, by default). If `bins` is a
        sequence, it defines a monotonically increasing array of bin edges,
        including the rightmost edge, allowing for non-uniform bin widths.

        .. versionadded:: 1.11.0

        If `bins` is a string, it defines the method used to calculate the
        optimal bin width, as defined by `histogram_bin_edges`.

    range : (float, float), optional
        The lower and upper range of the bins.  If not provided, range
        is simply ``(a.min(), a.max())``.  Values outside the range are
        ignored. The first element of the range must be less than or
        equal to the second. `range` affects the automatic bin
        computation as well. While bin width is computed to be optimal
        based on the actual data within `range`, the bin count will fill
        the entire range including portions containing no data.
    normed : bool, optional

        .. deprecated:: 1.6.0

        This is equivalent to the `density` argument, but produces incorrect
        results for unequal bin widths. It should not be used.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.15.0
            DeprecationWarnings are actually emitted.

    weights : array_like, optional
        An array of weights, of the same shape as `a`.  Each value in
        `a` only contributes its associated weight towards the bin count
        (instead of 1). If `density` is True, the weights are
        normalized, so that the integral of the density over the range
        remains 1.
    density : bool, optional
        If ``False``, the result will contain the number of samples in
        each bin. If ``True``, the result is the value of the
        probability *density* function at the bin, normalized such that
        the *integral* over the range is 1. Note that the sum of the
        histogram values will not be equal to 1 unless bins of unity
        width are chosen; it is not a probability *mass* function.

        Overrides the ``normed`` keyword if given.

    Returns
    -------
    hist : array
        The values of the histogram. See `density` and `weights` for a
        description of the possible semantics.
    bin_edges : array of dtype float
        Return the bin edges ``(length(hist)+1)``.

    histogramdd, bincount, searchsorted, digitize, histogram_bin_edges

    Notes
    -----
    All but the last (righthand-most) bin is half-open.  In other words,
    if `bins` is::

      [1, 2, 3, 4]

    then the first bin is ``[1, 2)`` (including 1, but excluding 2) and
    the second ``[2, 3)``.  The last bin, however, is ``[3, 4]``, which
    *includes* 4.


    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.histogram([1, 2, 1], bins=[0, 1, 2, 3])
    (array([0, 2, 1]), array([0, 1, 2, 3]))
    >>> np.histogram(np.arange(4), bins=np.arange(5), density=True)
    (array([ 0.25,  0.25,  0.25,  0.25]), array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]))
    >>> np.histogram([[1, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1]], bins=[0,1,2,3])
    (array([1, 4, 1]), array([0, 1, 2, 3]))

    >>> a = np.arange(5)
    >>> hist, bin_edges = np.histogram(a, density=True)
    >>> hist
    array([ 0.5,  0. ,  0.5,  0. ,  0. ,  0.5,  0. ,  0.5,  0. ,  0.5])
    >>> hist.sum()
    2.4999999999999996
    >>> np.sum(hist * np.diff(bin_edges))
    1.0

    .. versionadded:: 1.11.0

    Automated Bin Selection Methods example, using 2 peak random data
    with 2000 points:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> rng = np.random.RandomState(10)  # deterministic random data
    >>> a = np.hstack((rng.normal(size=1000),
    ...                rng.normal(loc=5, scale=2, size=1000)))
    >>> plt.hist(a, bins='auto')  # arguments are passed to np.histogram
    >>> plt.title("Histogram with 'auto' bins")
    >>> plt.show()

    `bins[{}]` must be monotonically increasing, when an array
        Increment the multi-dimensional index by one.

        ndindex.__next__IndexExpression.__getitem__RClass.__init__
    Multidimensional index iterator.

    Return an iterator yielding pairs of array coordinates and values.

    Parameters

    arr : ndarray
      Input array.

    --------
    ndindex, flatiter

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> for index, x in np.ndenumerate(a):
    ...     print(index, x)
    (0, 0) 1
    (0, 1) 2
    (1, 0) 3
    (1, 1) 4

    ndincr
    An N-dimensional iterator object to index arrays.

    Given the shape of an array, an `ndindex` instance iterates over
    the N-dimensional index of the array. At each iteration a tuple
    of indices is returned, the last dimension is iterated over first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `*args` : ints
      The size of each dimension of the array.

    --------
    ndenumerate, flatiter

    Examples
    --------
    >>> for index in np.ndindex(3, 2, 1):

    (0, 0, 0)
    (0, 1, 0)
    (1, 0, 0)
    (1, 1, 0)
    (2, 0, 0)
    (2, 1, 0)

    
    Return the indices to access the main diagonal of an array.

    This returns a tuple of indices that can be used to access the main
    diagonal of an array `a` with ``a.ndim >= 2`` dimensions and shape
    (n, n, ..., n). For ``a.ndim = 2`` this is the usual diagonal, for
    ``a.ndim > 2`` this is the set of indices to access ``a[i, i, ..., i]``
    for ``i = [0..n-1]``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
      The size, along each dimension, of the arrays for which the returned
      indices can be used.

    ndim : int, optional
      The number of dimensions.

    .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

    Examples
    --------
    Create a set of indices to access the diagonal of a (4, 4) array:

    >>> di = np.diag_indices(4)
    >>> di
    (array([0, 1, 2, 3]), array([0, 1, 2, 3]))
    >>> a = np.arange(16).reshape(4, 4)
    >>> a
    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
           [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
           [ 8,  9, 10, 11],
           [12, 13, 14, 15]])
    >>> a[di] = 100
    >>> a
    array([[100,   1,   2,   3],
           [  4, 100,   6,   7],
           [  8,   9, 100,  11],
           [ 12,  13,  14, 100]])

    Now, we create indices to manipulate a 3-D array:

    >>> d3 = np.diag_indices(2, 3)
    >>> d3
    (array([0, 1]), array([0, 1]), array([0, 1]))

    And use it to set the diagonal of an array of zeros to 1:

    >>> a = np.zeros((2, 2, 2), dtype=int)
    >>> a[d3] = 1
    >>> a
    array([[[1, 0],
            [0, 0]],
           [[0, 0],
            [0, 1]]])

    AxisConcatenator.__len__
    `nd_grid` instance which returns a dense multi-dimensional "meshgrid".

    An instance of `numpy.lib.index_tricks.nd_grid` which returns an dense
    (or fleshed out) mesh-grid when indexed, so that each returned argument
    has the same shape.  The dimensions and number of the output arrays are
    equal to the number of indexing dimensions.  If the step length is not a
    complex number, then the stop is not inclusive.

    However, if the step length is a **complex number** (e.g. 5j), then
    the integer part of its magnitude is interpreted as specifying the
    number of points to create between the start and stop values, where
    the stop value **is inclusive**.

    Returns
    ----------
    mesh-grid `ndarrays` all of the same dimensions

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.lib.index_tricks.nd_grid : class of `ogrid` and `mgrid` objects
    ogrid : like mgrid but returns open (not fleshed out) mesh grids

    --------
    >>> np.mgrid[0:5,0:5]
    array([[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
            [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
            [2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
            [3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]],
           [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
            [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
            [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
            [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
            [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]]])
    >>> np.mgrid[-1:1:5j]
    array([-1. , -0.5,  0. ,  0.5,  1. ])

    
    Construct an open mesh from multiple sequences.

    This function takes N 1-D sequences and returns N outputs with N
    dimensions each, such that the shape is 1 in all but one dimension
    and the dimension with the non-unit shape value cycles through all
    N dimensions.

    Using `ix_` one can quickly construct index arrays that will index
    the cross product. ``a[np.ix_([1,3],[2,5])]`` returns the array
    ``[[a[1,2] a[1,5]], [a[3,2] a[3,5]]]``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    args : 1-D sequences
        Each sequence should be of integer or boolean type.
        Boolean sequences will be interpreted as boolean masks for the
        corresponding dimension (equivalent to passing in
        ``np.nonzero(boolean_sequence)``).

    Returns
    -------
    out : tuple of ndarrays
        N arrays with N dimensions each, with N the number of input
        sequences. Together these arrays form an open mesh.

        Standard iterator method, returns the index tuple and array value.

        Returns
        -------
        coords : tuple of ints
            The indices of the current iteration.
        val : scalar
            The array element of the current iteration.

        ndindex.ndincr
    Translates slice objects to concatenation along the first axis.

    This is a simple way to build up arrays quickly. There are two use cases.

    1. If the index expression contains comma separated arrays, then stack
       them along their first axis.
    2. If the index expression contains slice notation or scalars then create
       a 1-D array with a range indicated by the slice notation.

    If slice notation is used, the syntax ``start:stop:step`` is equivalent
    to ``np.arange(start, stop, step)`` inside of the brackets. However, if
    ``step`` is an imaginary number (i.e. 100j) then its integer portion is
    interpreted as a number-of-points desired and the start and stop are
    inclusive. In other words ``start:stop:stepj`` is interpreted as
    ``np.linspace(start, stop, step, endpoint=1)`` inside of the brackets.
    After expansion of slice notation, all comma separated sequences are
    concatenated together.

    Optional character strings placed as the first element of the index
    expression can be used to change the output. The strings 'r' or 'c' result
    in matrix output. If the result is 1-D and 'r' is specified a 1 x N (row)
    matrix is produced. If the result is 1-D and 'c' is specified, then a N x 1
    (column) matrix is produced. If the result is 2-D then both provide the
    same matrix result.

    A string integer specifies which axis to stack multiple comma separated
    arrays along. A string of two comma-separated integers allows indication
    of the minimum number of dimensions to force each entry into as the
    second integer (the axis to concatenate along is still the first integer).

    A string with three comma-separated integers allows specification of the
    axis to concatenate along, the minimum number of dimensions to force the
    entries to, and which axis should contain the start of the arrays which
    are less than the specified number of dimensions. In other words the third
    integer allows you to specify where the 1's should be placed in the shape
    of the arrays that have their shapes upgraded. By default, they are placed
    in the front of the shape tuple. The third argument allows you to specify
    where the start of the array should be instead. Thus, a third argument of
    '0' would place the 1's at the end of the array shape. Negative integers
    specify where in the new shape tuple the last dimension of upgraded arrays
    should be placed, so the default is '-1'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Not a function, so takes no parameters


    Returns
    -------
    A concatenated ndarray or matrix.

    See Also
    --------
    concatenate : Join a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.
    c_ : Translates slice objects to concatenation along the second axis.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.r_[np.array([1,2,3]), 0, 0, np.array([4,5,6])]
    array([1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 4, 5, 6])
    >>> np.r_[-1:1:6j, [0]*3, 5, 6]
    array([-1. , -0.6, -0.2,  0.2,  0.6,  1. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  5. ,  6. ])

    String integers specify the axis to concatenate along or the minimum
    number of dimensions to force entries into.

    >>> a = np.array([[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]])
    >>> np.r_['-1', a, a] # concatenate along last axis
    array([[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5]])
    >>> np.r_['0,2', [1,2,3], [4,5,6]] # concatenate along first axis, dim>=2
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])

    >>> np.r_['0,2,0', [1,2,3], [4,5,6]]
    array([[1],
           [2],
           [3],
           [4],
           [5],
           [6]])
    >>> np.r_['1,2,0', [1,2,3], [4,5,6]]
    array([[1, 4],
           [2, 5],
           [3, 6]])

    Using 'r' or 'c' as a first string argument creates a matrix.

    >>> np.r_['r',[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]
    matrix([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]])

    unknown special directiveCClass.__init__input array must be at least 2-d
        Standard iterator method, updates the index and returns the index
        tuple.

        Returns
        -------
        val : tuple of ints
            Returns a tuple containing the indices of the current
            iteration.

        
    A nicer way to build up index tuples for arrays.

    .. note::
       Use one of the two predefined instances `index_exp` or `s_`
       rather than directly using `IndexExpression`.

    For any index combination, including slicing and axis insertion,
    ``a[indices]`` is the same as ``a[np.index_exp[indices]]`` for any
    array `a`. However, ``np.index_exp[indices]`` can be used anywhere
    in Python code and returns a tuple of slice objects that can be
    used in the construction of complex index expressions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    maketuple : bool
        If True, always returns a tuple.

    See Also
    --------
    index_exp : Predefined instance that always returns a tuple:
       `index_exp = IndexExpression(maketuple=True)`.
    s_ : Predefined instance without tuple conversion:
       `s_ = IndexExpression(maketuple=False)`.

    Notes
    -----
    You can do all this with `slice()` plus a few special objects,
    but there's a lot to remember and this version is simpler because
    it uses the standard array indexing syntax.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.s_[2::2]
    slice(2, None, 2)
    >>> np.index_exp[2::2]
    (slice(2, None, 2),)

    >>> np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])[np.s_[2::2]]
    array([2, 4])

    
    Return the indices to access the main diagonal of an n-dimensional array.

    See `diag_indices` for full details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array, at least 2-D

    See Also
    --------
    diag_indices

    .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

    OGridClass.__init__AxisConcatenator.__init__
    Translates slice objects to concatenation along the second axis.

    This is short-hand for ``np.r_['-1,2,0', index expression]``, which is
    useful because of its common occurrence. In particular, arrays will be
    stacked along their last axis after being upgraded to at least 2-D with
    1's post-pended to the shape (column vectors made out of 1-D arrays).
    
    See Also
    --------
    column_stack : Stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array.
    r_ : For more detailed documentation.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.c_[np.array([1,2,3]), np.array([4,5,6])]
    array([[1, 4],
           [2, 5],
           [3, 6]])
    >>> np.c_[np.array([[1,2,3]]), 0, 0, np.array([[4,5,6]])]
    array([[1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 4, 5, 6]])

    _diag_indices_fromndindex.__init__nd_grid.__getitem__Fill the main diagonal of the given array of any dimensionality.

    For an array `a` with ``a.ndim >= 2``, the diagonal is the list of
    locations with indices ``a[i, ..., i]`` all identical. This function
    modifies the input array in-place, it does not return a value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array, at least 2-D.
      Array whose diagonal is to be filled, it gets modified in-place.

    val : scalar
      Value to be written on the diagonal, its type must be compatible with
      that of the array a.

    wrap : bool
      For tall matrices in NumPy version up to 1.6.2, the
      diagonal "wrapped" after N columns. You can have this behavior
      with this option. This affects only tall matrices.

    See also
    --------
    diag_indices, diag_indices_from

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

    This functionality can be obtained via `diag_indices`, but internally
    this version uses a much faster implementation that never constructs the
    indices and uses simple slicing.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.zeros((3, 3), int)
    >>> np.fill_diagonal(a, 5)
    >>> a
    array([[5, 0, 0],
           [0, 5, 0],
           [0, 0, 5]])

    The same function can operate on a 4-D array:

    >>> a = np.zeros((3, 3, 3, 3), int)
    >>> np.fill_diagonal(a, 4)

    We only show a few blocks for clarity:

    >>> a[0, 0]
    array([[4, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0]])
    >>> a[1, 1]
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [0, 0, 0]])
    >>> a[2, 2]
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 4]])

    The wrap option affects only tall matrices:

    >>> # tall matrices no wrap
    >>> a = np.zeros((5, 3),int)
    >>> fill_diagonal(a, 4)
    >>> a
    array([[4, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [0, 0, 4],
           [0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0]])

    >>> # tall matrices wrap
    >>> a = np.zeros((5, 3),int)
    >>> fill_diagonal(a, 4, wrap=True)
    >>> a
    array([[4, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [0, 0, 4],
           [0, 0, 0],
           [4, 0, 0]])

    >>> # wide matrices
    >>> a = np.zeros((3, 5),int)
    >>> fill_diagonal(a, 4, wrap=True)
    >>> a
    array([[4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]])

    All dimensions of input must be of equal length
    `nd_grid` instance which returns an open multi-dimensional "meshgrid".

    An instance of `numpy.lib.index_tricks.nd_grid` which returns an open
    (i.e. not fleshed out) mesh-grid when indexed, so that only one dimension
    of each returned array is greater than 1.  The dimension and number of the
    output arrays are equal to the number of indexing dimensions.  If the step
    length is not a complex number, then the stop is not inclusive.

    However, if the step length is a **complex number** (e.g. 5j), then
    the integer part of its magnitude is interpreted as specifying the
    number of points to create between the start and stop values, where
    the stop value **is inclusive**.

    Returns
    ----------
    mesh-grid `ndarrays` with only one dimension :math:`\neq 1`

    See Also
    --------
    np.lib.index_tricks.nd_grid : class of `ogrid` and `mgrid` objects
    mgrid : like `ogrid` but returns dense (or fleshed out) mesh grids
    r_ : array concatenator

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy import ogrid
    >>> ogrid[-1:1:5j]
    array([-1. , -0.5,  0. ,  0.5,  1. ])
    >>> ogrid[0:5,0:5]
    [array([[0],
            [1],
            [2],
            [3],
            [4]]), array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]])]

    Cross index must be 1 dimensional
    Translates slice objects to concatenation along an axis.

    For detailed documentation on usage, see `r_`.
    ndenumerate.__iter__
    Construct a multi-dimensional "meshgrid".

    ``grid = nd_grid()`` creates an instance which will return a mesh-grid
    when indexed.  The dimension and number of the output arrays are equal
    to the number of indexing dimensions.  If the step length is not a
    complex number, then the stop is not inclusive.

    However, if the step length is a **complex number** (e.g. 5j), then the
    integer part of its magnitude is interpreted as specifying the
    number of points to create between the start and stop values, where
    the stop value **is inclusive**.

    If instantiated with an argument of ``sparse=True``, the mesh-grid is
    open (or not fleshed out) so that only one-dimension of each returned
    argument is greater than 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sparse : bool, optional
        Whether the grid is sparse or not. Default is False.

    Notes
    -----
    Two instances of `nd_grid` are made available in the NumPy namespace,
    `mgrid` and `ogrid`, approximately defined as::

        mgrid = nd_grid(sparse=False)
        ogrid = nd_grid(sparse=True)

    Users should use these pre-defined instances instead of using `nd_grid`
    directly.

floordivImplement a unary special method with a ufunc.Implement a reflected binary method with a ufunc, e.g., __radd__.Mixin defining all operator special methods using __array_ufunc__.

    This class implements the special methods for almost all of Python's
    builtin operators defined in the `operator` module, including comparisons
    (``==``, ``>``, etc.) and arithmetic (``+``, ``*``, ``-``, etc.), by
    deferring to the ``__array_ufunc__`` method, which subclasses must
    implement.

    It is useful for writing classes that do not inherit from `numpy.ndarray`,
    but that should support arithmetic and numpy universal functions like
    arrays as described in `A Mechanism for Overriding Ufuncs
    <../../neps/nep-0013-ufunc-overrides.html>`_.

    As an trivial example, consider this implementation of an ``ArrayLike``
    class that simply wraps a NumPy array and ensures that the result of any
    arithmetic operation is also an ``ArrayLike`` object::

        class ArrayLike(np.lib.mixins.NDArrayOperatorsMixin):
            def __init__(self, value):
                self.value = np.asarray(value)

            # One might also consider adding the built-in list type to this
            # list, to support operations like np.add(array_like, list)
            _HANDLED_TYPES = (np.ndarray, numbers.Number)

            def __array_ufunc__(self, ufunc, method, *inputs, **kwargs):
                out = kwargs.get('out', ())
                for x in inputs + out:
                    # Only support operations with instances of _HANDLED_TYPES.
                    # Use ArrayLike instead of type(self) for isinstance to
                    # allow subclasses that don't override __array_ufunc__ to
                    # handle ArrayLike objects.
                    if not isinstance(x, self._HANDLED_TYPES + (ArrayLike,)):
                        return NotImplemented

                # Defer to the implementation of the ufunc on unwrapped values.
                inputs = tuple(x.value if isinstance(x, ArrayLike) else x
                               for x in inputs)
                if out:
                    kwargs['out'] = tuple(
                        x.value if isinstance(x, ArrayLike) else x
                        for x in out)
                result = getattr(ufunc, method)(*inputs, **kwargs)

                if type(result) is tuple:
                    # multiple return values
                    return tuple(type(self)(x) for x in result)
                elif method == 'at':
                    # no return value
                    return None
                else:
                    # one return value
                    return type(self)(result)

            def __repr__(self):
                return '%s(%r)' % (type(self).__name__, self.value)

    In interactions between ``ArrayLike`` objects and numbers or numpy arrays,
    the result is always another ``ArrayLike``:

        >>> x = ArrayLike([1, 2, 3])
        >>> x - 1
        ArrayLike(array([0, 1, 2]))
        >>> 1 - x
        ArrayLike(array([ 0, -1, -2]))
        >>> np.arange(3) - x
        ArrayLike(array([-1, -1, -1]))
        >>> x - np.arange(3)
        ArrayLike(array([1, 1, 1]))

    Note that unlike ``numpy.ndarray``, ``ArrayLike`` does not allow operations
    with arbitrary, unrecognized types. This ensures that interactions with
    ArrayLike preserve a well-defined casting hierarchy.

    Return the indices of the maximum values in the specified axis ignoring
    NaNs. For all-NaN slices ``ValueError`` is raised. Warning: the
    results cannot be trusted if a slice contains only NaNs and -Infs.


    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to operate.  By default flattened input is used.

    Returns
    -------
    index_array : ndarray
        An array of indices or a single index value.

    See Also
    --------
    argmax, nanargmin

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[np.nan, 4], [2, 3]])
    >>> np.argmax(a)
    0
    >>> np.nanargmax(a)
    1
    >>> np.nanargmax(a, axis=0)

    >>> np.nanargmax(a, axis=1)
    array([1, 1])

    
    Compute the qth quantile of the data along the specified axis,
    while ignoring nan values.
    Returns the qth quantile(s) of the array elements.
    .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array, containing
        nan values to be ignored
    q : array_like of float
        Quantile or sequence of quantiles to compute, which must be between
        0 and 1 inclusive.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the quantiles are computed. The
        default is to compute the quantile(s) along a flattened
        version of the array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
        but the type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
        If True, then allow the input array `a` to be modified by intermediate
        calculations, to save memory. In this case, the contents of the input
        `a` after this function completes is undefined.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to
        use when the desired quantile lies between two data points
        ``i < j``:

        * linear: ``i + (j - i) * fraction``, where ``fraction``
          is the fractional part of the index surrounded by ``i``
          and ``j``.
        * lower: ``i``.
        * higher: ``j``.
        * nearest: ``i`` or ``j``, whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: ``(i + j) / 2``.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in
        the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the
        result will broadcast correctly against the original array `a`.

        If this is anything but the default value it will be passed
        through (in the special case of an empty array) to the
        `mean` function of the underlying array.  If the array is
        a sub-class and `mean` does not have the kwarg `keepdims` this
        will raise a RuntimeError.

    Returns
    -------
    quantile : scalar or ndarray
        If `q` is a single percentile and `axis=None`, then the result
        is a scalar. If multiple quantiles are given, first axis of
        the result corresponds to the quantiles. The other axes are
        the axes that remain after the reduction of `a`. If the input
        contains integers or floats smaller than ``float64``, the output
        data-type is ``float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    See Also
    --------
    quantile
    nanmean, nanmedian
    nanmedian : equivalent to ``nanquantile(..., 0.5)``
    nanpercentile : same as nanquantile, but with q in the range [0, 100].

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[10., 7., 4.], [3., 2., 1.]])
    >>> a[0][1] = np.nan
    >>> a
    array([[ 10.,  nan,   4.],
          [  3.,   2.,   1.]])
    >>> np.quantile(a, 0.5)
    nan
    >>> np.nanquantile(a, 0.5)
    3.5
    >>> np.nanquantile(a, 0.5, axis=0)
    array([ 6.5,  2.,   2.5])
    >>> np.nanquantile(a, 0.5, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    array([[ 7.],
           [ 2.]])
    >>> m = np.nanquantile(a, 0.5, axis=0)
    >>> out = np.zeros_like(m)
    >>> np.nanquantile(a, 0.5, axis=0, out=out)
    array([ 6.5,  2.,   2.5])
    >>> m
    array([ 6.5,  2. ,  2.5])
    >>> b = a.copy()
    >>> np.nanquantile(b, 0.5, axis=1, overwrite_input=True)
    array([  7.,  2.])
    >>> assert not np.all(a==b)
    _nansum_dispatcher
    Compute the arithmetic mean along the specified axis, ignoring NaNs.

    Returns the average of the array elements.  The average is taken over
    the flattened array by default, otherwise over the specified axis.
    `float64` intermediate and return values are used for integer inputs.

    For all-NaN slices, NaN is returned and a `RuntimeWarning` is raised.

    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose mean is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the means are computed. The default is to compute
        the mean of the flattened array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Type to use in computing the mean.  For integer inputs, the default
        is `float64`; for inexact inputs, it is the same as the input
        dtype.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary.  See
        `doc.ufuncs` for details.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

        If the value is anything but the default, then
        `keepdims` will be passed through to the `mean` or `sum` methods
        of sub-classes of `ndarray`.  If the sub-classes methods
        does not implement `keepdims` any exceptions will be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    m : ndarray, see dtype parameter above
        If `out=None`, returns a new array containing the mean values,
        otherwise a reference to the output array is returned. Nan is
        returned for slices that contain only NaNs.

    See Also
    --------
    average : Weighted average
    mean : Arithmetic mean taken while not ignoring NaNs
    var, nanvar

    Notes
    -----
    The arithmetic mean is the sum of the non-NaN elements along the axis
    divided by the number of non-NaN elements.

    Note that for floating-point input, the mean is computed using the same
    precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32`.  Specifying a
    higher-precision accumulator using the `dtype` keyword can alleviate
    this issue.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, np.nan], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.nanmean(a)
    2.6666666666666665
    >>> np.nanmean(a, axis=0)
    array([ 2.,  4.])
    >>> np.nanmean(a, axis=1)
    array([ 1.,  3.5])

    isbad_nanpercentile_dispatcher_nanquantile_1d
    Equivalent to arr1d[~arr1d.isnan()], but in a different order

    Presumably faster as it incurs fewer copies

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr1d : ndarray
        Array to remove nans from
    overwrite_input : bool
        True if `arr1d` can be modified in place

    Returns
    -------
    res : ndarray
        Array with nan elements removed
    overwrite_input : bool
        True if `res` can be modified in place, given the constraint on the
        input
    _nanprod_dispatcher_nanmedian_dispatcher
    Compute the variance along the specified axis, while ignoring NaNs.

    Returns the variance of the array elements, a measure of the spread of
    a distribution.  The variance is computed for the flattened array by
    default, otherwise over the specified axis.

    For all-NaN slices or slices with zero degrees of freedom, NaN is
    returned and a `RuntimeWarning` is raised.

    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose variance is desired.  If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the variance is computed.  The default is to compute
        the variance of the flattened array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Type to use in computing the variance.  For arrays of integer type
        the default is `float32`; for arrays of float types it is the same as
        the array type.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  It must have
        the same shape as the expected output, but the type is cast if
        necessary.
    ddof : int, optional
        "Delta Degrees of Freedom": the divisor used in the calculation is
        ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of non-NaN
        elements. By default `ddof` is zero.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.


    Returns
    -------
    variance : ndarray, see dtype parameter above
        If `out` is None, return a new array containing the variance,
        otherwise return a reference to the output array. If ddof is >= the
        number of non-NaN elements in a slice or the slice contains only
        NaNs, then the result for that slice is NaN.

    See Also
    --------
    std : Standard deviation
    mean : Average
    var : Variance while not ignoring NaNs
    nanstd, nanmean
    numpy.doc.ufuncs : Section "Output arguments"

    Notes
    -----
    The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean,
    i.e.,  ``var = mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2)``.

    The mean is normally calculated as ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.
    If, however, `ddof` is specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used
    instead.  In standard statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an
    unbiased estimator of the variance of a hypothetical infinite
    population.  ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the
    variance for normally distributed variables.

    Note that for complex numbers, the absolute value is taken before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the variance is computed using the same
    precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see example
    below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the ``dtype``
    keyword can alleviate this issue.

    For this function to work on sub-classes of ndarray, they must define
    `sum` with the kwarg `keepdims`

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, np.nan], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.var(a)
    1.5555555555555554
    >>> np.nanvar(a, axis=0)
    array([ 1.,  0.])
    >>> np.nanvar(a, axis=1)
    array([ 0.,  0.25])

    enonan_replace_nan_nanmedian1d
    Compute the qth percentile of the data along the specified axis,
    while ignoring nan values.

    Returns the qth percentile(s) of the array elements.

    .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array, containing
        nan values to be ignored.
    q : array_like of float
        Percentile or sequence of percentiles to compute, which must be between
        0 and 100 inclusive.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the percentiles are computed. The
        default is to compute the percentile(s) along a flattened
        version of the array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
        but the type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
        If True, then allow the input array `a` to be modified by intermediate
        calculations, to save memory. In this case, the contents of the input
        `a` after this function completes is undefined.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to
        use when the desired percentile lies between two data points
        ``i < j``:

        * 'linear': ``i + (j - i) * fraction``, where ``fraction``
          is the fractional part of the index surrounded by ``i``
          and ``j``.
        * 'lower': ``i``.
        * 'higher': ``j``.
        * 'nearest': ``i`` or ``j``, whichever is nearest.
        * 'midpoint': ``(i + j) / 2``.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in
        the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the
        result will broadcast correctly against the original array `a`.

        If this is anything but the default value it will be passed
        through (in the special case of an empty array) to the
        `mean` function of the underlying array.  If the array is
        a sub-class and `mean` does not have the kwarg `keepdims` this
        will raise a RuntimeError.

    Returns
    -------
    percentile : scalar or ndarray
        If `q` is a single percentile and `axis=None`, then the result
        is a scalar. If multiple percentiles are given, first axis of
        the result corresponds to the percentiles. The other axes are
        the axes that remain after the reduction of `a`. If the input
        contains integers or floats smaller than ``float64``, the output
        data-type is ``float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    See Also
    --------
    nanmean
    nanmedian : equivalent to ``nanpercentile(..., 50)``
    percentile, median, mean
    nanquantile : equivalent to nanpercentile, but with q in the range [0, 1].

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` of length ``N``, the ``q``-th percentile of
    ``V`` is the value ``q/100`` of the way from the minimum to the
    maximum in a sorted copy of ``V``. The values and distances of
    the two nearest neighbors as well as the `interpolation` parameter
    will determine the percentile if the normalized ranking does not
    match the location of ``q`` exactly. This function is the same as
    the median if ``q=50``, the same as the minimum if ``q=0`` and the
    same as the maximum if ``q=100``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[10., 7., 4.], [3., 2., 1.]])
    >>> a[0][1] = np.nan
    >>> a
    array([[ 10.,  nan,   4.],
          [  3.,   2.,   1.]])
    >>> np.percentile(a, 50)
    nan
    >>> np.nanpercentile(a, 50)
    3.5
    >>> np.nanpercentile(a, 50, axis=0)
    array([ 6.5,  2.,   2.5])
    >>> np.nanpercentile(a, 50, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    array([[ 7.],
           [ 2.]])
    >>> m = np.nanpercentile(a, 50, axis=0)
    >>> out = np.zeros_like(m)
    >>> np.nanpercentile(a, 50, axis=0, out=out)
    array([ 6.5,  2.,   2.5])
    >>> m
    array([ 6.5,  2. ,  2.5])

    >>> b = a.copy()
    >>> np.nanpercentile(b, 50, axis=1, overwrite_input=True)
    array([  7.,  2.])
    >>> assert not np.all(a==b)

    
    Compute a/b ignoring invalid results. If `a` is an array the division
    is done in place. If `a` is a scalar, then its type is preserved in the
    output. If out is None, then then a is used instead so that the
    division is in place. Note that this is only called with `a` an inexact
    type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : {ndarray, numpy scalar}
        Numerator. Expected to be of inexact type but not checked.
    b : {ndarray, numpy scalar}
        Denominator.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary.

    Returns
    -------
    ret : {ndarray, numpy scalar}
        The return value is a/b. If `a` was an ndarray the division is done
        in place. If `a` is a numpy scalar, the division preserves its type.

    
    Replace values in `a` with NaN where `mask` is True.  This differs from
    copyto in that it will deal with the case where `a` is a numpy scalar.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray or numpy scalar
        Array or numpy scalar some of whose values are to be replaced
        by val.
    val : numpy scalar
        Value used a replacement.
    mask : ndarray, scalar
        Boolean array. Where True the corresponding element of `a` is
        replaced by `val`. Broadcasts.

    Returns
    -------
    res : ndarray, scalar
        Array with elements replaced or scalar `val`.

    
    Return the maximum of an array or maximum along an axis, ignoring any
    NaNs.  When all-NaN slices are encountered a ``RuntimeWarning`` is
    raised and NaN is returned for that slice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose maximum is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the maximum is computed. The default is to compute
        the maximum of the flattened array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary.  See
        `doc.ufuncs` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

        If the value is anything but the default, then
        `keepdims` will be passed through to the `max` method
        of sub-classes of `ndarray`.  If the sub-classes methods
        does not implement `keepdims` any exceptions will be raised.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Returns
    -------
    nanmax : ndarray
        An array with the same shape as `a`, with the specified axis removed.
        If `a` is a 0-d array, or if axis is None, an ndarray scalar is
        returned.  The same dtype as `a` is returned.

        Shows which elements are neither NaN nor infinity.

    amin, fmin, minimum

    Notes
    -----
    NumPy uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic
    (IEEE 754). This means that Not a Number is not equivalent to infinity.
    Positive infinity is treated as a very large number and negative
    infinity is treated as a very small (i.e. negative) number.

    If the input has a integer type the function is equivalent to np.max.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nanmax(a)
    3.0
    >>> np.nanmax(a, axis=0)
    array([ 3.,  2.])
    >>> np.nanmax(a, axis=1)
    array([ 2.,  3.])

    When positive infinity and negative infinity are present:

    >>> np.nanmax([1, 2, np.nan, np.NINF])
    2.0
    >>> np.nanmax([1, 2, np.nan, np.inf])
    inf

    _nancumprod_dispatcher_nanquantile_ureduce_func_nanvar_dispatcher
    Return the indices of the minimum values in the specified axis ignoring
    NaNs. For all-NaN slices ``ValueError`` is raised. Warning: the results
    cannot be trusted if a slice contains only NaNs and Infs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to operate.  By default flattened input is used.

    -------
    index_array : ndarray
        An array of indices or a single index value.

_divide_by_count_nanmin_dispatcher
    Return the sum of array elements over a given axis treating Not a
    Numbers (NaNs) as zero.

    In NumPy versions <= 1.9.0 Nan is returned for slices that are all-NaN or
    empty. In later versions zero is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose sum is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the sum is computed. The default is to compute the
        sum of the flattened array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed.  By default, the dtype of `a` is used.  An
        exception is when `a` has an integer type with less precision than
        the platform (u)intp. In that case, the default will be either
        (u)int32 or (u)int64 depending on whether the platform is 32 or 64
        bits. For inexact inputs, dtype must be inexact.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``. If provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary.  See
        `doc.ufuncs` for details. The casting of NaN to integer can yield
        unexpected results.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.


        If the value is anything but the default, then
        `keepdims` will be passed through to the `mean` or `sum` methods
        of sub-classes of `ndarray`.  If the sub-classes methods
        does not implement `keepdims` any exceptions will be raised.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Returns
    -------
    nansum : ndarray.
        A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is
        specified, in which it is returned. The result has the same
        size as `a`, and the same shape as `a` if `axis` is not None
        or `a` is a 1-d array.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.sum : Sum across array propagating NaNs.
    isnan : Show which elements are NaN.
    isfinite: Show which elements are not NaN or +/-inf.

    Notes
    -----
    If both positive and negative infinity are present, the sum will be Not
    A Number (NaN).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.nansum(1)
    1
    >>> np.nansum([1])
    1
    >>> np.nansum([1, np.nan])
    1.0
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 1], [1, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nansum(a)
    3.0
    >>> np.nansum(a, axis=0)
    array([ 2.,  1.])
    >>> np.nansum([1, np.nan, np.inf])
    inf
    >>> np.nansum([1, np.nan, np.NINF])
    -inf
    >>> np.nansum([1, np.nan, np.inf, -np.inf]) # both +/- infinity present

    If a is inexact, then dtype must be inexact
    Private function for rank 1 arrays. Compute the median ignoring NaNs.
    See nanmedian for parameter usage
    _nanquantile_dispatcher_nanmedian_smallAll-NaN axis encountered
    Compute the standard deviation along the specified axis, while
    ignoring NaNs.

    Returns the standard deviation, a measure of the spread of a
    distribution, of the non-NaN array elements. The standard deviation is
    computed for the flattened array by default, otherwise over the
    specified axis.

    For all-NaN slices or slices with zero degrees of freedom, NaN is
    returned and a `RuntimeWarning` is raised.

    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Calculate the standard deviation of the non-NaN values.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the standard deviation is computed. The default is
        to compute the standard deviation of the flattened array.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type to use in computing the standard deviation. For arrays of
        integer type the default is float64, for arrays of float types it
        is the same as the array type.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape as the expected output but the type (of the
        calculated values) will be cast if necessary.
    ddof : int, optional
        Means Delta Degrees of Freedom.  The divisor used in calculations
        is ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of non-NaN
        elements.  By default `ddof` is zero.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

        If this value is anything but the default it is passed through
        as-is to the relevant functions of the sub-classes.  If these
        functions do not have a `keepdims` kwarg, a RuntimeError will
        be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    standard_deviation : ndarray, see dtype parameter above.
        If `out` is None, return a new array containing the standard
        deviation, otherwise return a reference to the output array. If
        ddof is >= the number of non-NaN elements in a slice or the slice
        contains only NaNs, then the result for that slice is NaN.

    See Also
    --------
    var, mean, std
    nanvar, nanmean
    numpy.doc.ufuncs : Section "Output arguments"

    Notes
    -----
    The standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squared
    deviations from the mean: ``std = sqrt(mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2))``.

    The average squared deviation is normally calculated as
    ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.  If, however, `ddof` is
    specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used instead. In standard
    statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an unbiased estimator of the
    variance of the infinite population. ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum
    likelihood estimate of the variance for normally distributed variables.
    The standard deviation computed in this function is the square root of
    the estimated variance, so even with ``ddof=1``, it will not be an
    unbiased estimate of the standard deviation per se.

    Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute value before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the *std* is computed using the same
    precision the input has. Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for float32 (see example
    below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the `dtype`
    keyword can alleviate this issue.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, np.nan], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.nanstd(a)
    1.247219128924647
    >>> np.nanstd(a, axis=0)
    array([ 1.,  0.])
    >>> np.nanstd(a, axis=1)
    array([ 0.,  0.5])

    
    Return the product of array elements over a given axis treating Not a
    Numbers (NaNs) as ones.

    One is returned for slices that are all-NaN or empty.

    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose product is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the product is computed. The default is to compute
        the product of the flattened array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed.  By default, the dtype of `a` is used.  An
        exception is when `a` has an integer type with less precision than
        the platform (u)intp. In that case, the default will be either
        (u)int32 or (u)int64 depending on whether the platform is 32 or 64
        bits. For inexact inputs, dtype must be inexact.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``. If provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary.  See
        `doc.ufuncs` for details. The casting of NaN to integer can yield
        unexpected results.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as
        dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will
        broadcast correctly against the original `arr`.

    Returns
    -------
    nanprod : ndarray
        A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is
        specified, in which case it is returned.

    See Also

    >>> np.nanprod([1])
    1
    >>> np.nanprod([1, np.nan])
    1.0
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nanprod(a)
    6.0
    >>> np.nanprod(a, axis=0)
    array([ 3.,  2.])

    
    Return the cumulative product of array elements over a given axis treating Not a
    Numbers (NaNs) as one.  The cumulative product does not change when NaNs are
    encountered and leading NaNs are replaced by ones.

    Ones are returned for slices that are all-NaN or empty.

    .. versionadded:: 1.12.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the cumulative product is computed.  By default
        the input is flattened.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type of the returned array, as well as of the accumulator in which
        the elements are multiplied.  If *dtype* is not specified, it
        defaults to the dtype of `a`, unless `a` has an integer dtype with
        a precision less than that of the default platform integer.  In
        that case, the default platform integer is used instead.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output
        but the type of the resulting values will be cast if necessary.

    Returns
    -------
    nancumprod : ndarray
        A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is
        specified, in which case it is returned.

    If a is inexact, then out must be inexact/home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/lib/nanfunctions.py
    Return minimum of an array or minimum along an axis, ignoring any NaNs.
    When all-NaN slices are encountered a ``RuntimeWarning`` is raised and
    Nan is returned for that slice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose minimum is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the minimum is computed. The default is to compute
        the minimum of the flattened array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary.  See
        `doc.ufuncs` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

        If the value is anything but the default, then
        `keepdims` will be passed through to the `min` method
        of sub-classes of `ndarray`.  If the sub-classes methods
        does not implement `keepdims` any exceptions will be raised.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Returns
    -------
    nanmin : ndarray
        An array with the same shape as `a`, with the specified axis
        removed.  If `a` is a 0-d array, or if axis is None, an ndarray
        scalar is returned.  The same dtype as `a` is returned.

    amax, fmax, maximum

    Notes
    -----
    NumPy uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic
    (IEEE 754). This means that Not a Number is not equivalent to infinity.
    Positive infinity is treated as a very large number and negative
    infinity is treated as a very small (i.e. negative) number.

    If the input has a integer type the function is equivalent to np.min.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nanmin(a)
    1.0
    >>> np.nanmin(a, axis=0)
    array([ 1.,  2.])
    >>> np.nanmin(a, axis=1)
    array([ 1.,  3.])

    When positive infinity and negative infinity are present:

    >>> np.nanmin([1, 2, np.nan, np.inf])
    1.0
    >>> np.nanmin([1, 2, np.nan, np.NINF])
    -inf

    <module numpy.lib.nanfunctions>
    Compute the median along the specified axis, while ignoring NaNs.

    Returns the median of the array elements.

    .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : {int, sequence of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the medians are computed. The default
        is to compute the median along a flattened version of the array.
        A sequence of axes is supported since version 1.9.0.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
        but the type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
       If True, then allow use of memory of input array `a` for
       calculations. The input array will be modified by the call to
       `median`. This will save memory when you do not need to preserve
       the contents of the input array. Treat the input as undefined,
       but it will probably be fully or partially sorted. Default is
       False. If `overwrite_input` is ``True`` and `a` is not already an
       `ndarray`, an error will be raised.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

        If this is anything but the default value it will be passed
        through (in the special case of an empty array) to the
        `mean` function of the underlying array.  If the array is
        a sub-class and `mean` does not have the kwarg `keepdims` this
        will raise a RuntimeError.

    Returns
    -------
    median : ndarray
        A new array holding the result. If the input contains integers
        or floats smaller than ``float64``, then the output data-type is
        ``np.float64``.  Otherwise, the data-type of the output is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    See Also
    --------
    mean, median, percentile

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` of length ``N``, the median of ``V`` is the
    middle value of a sorted copy of ``V``, ``V_sorted`` - i.e.,
    ``V_sorted[(N-1)/2]``, when ``N`` is odd and the average of the two
    middle values of ``V_sorted`` when ``N`` is even.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[10.0, 7, 4], [3, 2, 1]])
    >>> a[0, 1] = np.nan
    >>> a
    array([[ 10.,  nan,   4.],
       [  3.,   2.,   1.]])
    >>> np.median(a)
    nan
    >>> np.nanmedian(a)

    >>> b = a.copy()
    >>> np.nanmedian(b, axis=1, overwrite_input=True)
    array([ 7.,  2.])
    >>> assert not np.all(a==b)
    >>> b = a.copy()
    >>> np.nanmedian(b, axis=None, overwrite_input=True)
    3.0
    >>> assert not np.all(a==b)

    _nanmax_dispatcher
    If `a` is of inexact type, make a copy of `a`, replace NaNs with
    the `val` value, and return the copy together with a boolean mask
    marking the locations where NaNs were present. If `a` is not of
    inexact type, do nothing and return `a` together with a mask of None.

    Note that scalars will end up as array scalars, which is important
    for using the result as the value of the out argument in some
    operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array-like
        Input array.
    val : float
        NaN values are set to val before doing the operation.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        If `a` is of inexact type, return a copy of `a` with the NaNs
        replaced by the fill value, otherwise return `a`.
    mask: {bool, None}
        If `a` is of inexact type, return a boolean mask marking locations of
        NaNs, otherwise return None.

    _nanargmin_dispatcher_nanstd_dispatcher
    Return the cumulative sum of array elements over a given axis treating Not a
    Numbers (NaNs) as zero.  The cumulative sum does not change when NaNs are
    encountered and leading NaNs are replaced by zeros.

    Zeros are returned for slices that are all-NaN or empty.

    .. versionadded:: 1.12.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the cumulative sum is computed. The default
        (None) is to compute the cumsum over the flattened array.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed.  If `dtype` is not specified, it defaults
        to the dtype of `a`, unless `a` has an integer dtype with a
        precision less than that of the default platform integer.  In
        that case, the default platform integer is used.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output
        but the type will be cast if necessary. See `doc.ufuncs`
        (Section "Output arguments") for more details.

    Returns
    -------
    nancumsum : ndarray.
        A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is
        specified, in which it is returned. The result has the same
        size as `a`, and the same shape as `a` if `axis` is not None
        or `a` is a 1-d array.

    Load arrays or pickled objects from ``.npy``, ``.npz`` or pickled files.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file : file-like object, string, or pathlib.Path
        The file to read. File-like objects must support the
        ``seek()`` and ``read()`` methods. Pickled files require that the
        file-like object support the ``readline()`` method as well.
    mmap_mode : {None, 'r+', 'r', 'w+', 'c'}, optional
        If not None, then memory-map the file, using the given mode (see
        `numpy.memmap` for a detailed description of the modes).  A
        memory-mapped array is kept on disk. However, it can be accessed
        and sliced like any ndarray.  Memory mapping is especially useful
        for accessing small fragments of large files without reading the
        entire file into memory.
    allow_pickle : bool, optional
        Allow loading pickled object arrays stored in npy files. Reasons for
        disallowing pickles include security, as loading pickled data can
        execute arbitrary code. If pickles are disallowed, loading object
        arrays will fail. Default: False

        .. versionchanged:: 1.16.3
            Made default False in response to CVE-2019-6446.

    fix_imports : bool, optional
        Only useful when loading Python 2 generated pickled files on Python 3,
        which includes npy/npz files containing object arrays. If `fix_imports`
        is True, pickle will try to map the old Python 2 names to the new names
        used in Python 3.
    encoding : str, optional
        What encoding to use when reading Python 2 strings. Only useful when
        loading Python 2 generated pickled files in Python 3, which includes
        npy/npz files containing object arrays. Values other than 'latin1',
        'ASCII', and 'bytes' are not allowed, as they can corrupt numerical
        data. Default: 'ASCII'

    Returns
    -------
    result : array, tuple, dict, etc.
        Data stored in the file. For ``.npz`` files, the returned instance
        of NpzFile class must be closed to avoid leaking file descriptors.

    Raises
    ------
    IOError
        If the input file does not exist or cannot be read.
    ValueError
        The file contains an object array, but allow_pickle=False given.

    See Also
    --------
    save, savez, savez_compressed, loadtxt
    memmap : Create a memory-map to an array stored in a file on disk.
    lib.format.open_memmap : Create or load a memory-mapped ``.npy`` file.

    Notes
    -----
    - If the file contains pickle data, then whatever object is stored
      in the pickle is returned.
    - If the file is a ``.npy`` file, then a single array is returned.
    - If the file is a ``.npz`` file, then a dictionary-like object is
      returned, containing ``{filename: array}`` key-value pairs, one for
      each file in the archive.
    - If the file is a ``.npz`` file, the returned value supports the
      context manager protocol in a similar fashion to the open function::

        with load('foo.npz') as data:
            a = data['a']

      The underlying file descriptor is closed when exiting the 'with'
      block.

    Examples
    --------
    Store data to disk, and load it again:

    >>> np.save('/tmp/123', np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]))
    >>> np.load('/tmp/123.npy')
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])

    Store compressed data to disk, and load it again:

    >>> a=np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> b=np.array([1, 2])
    >>> np.savez('/tmp/123.npz', a=a, b=b)
    >>> data = np.load('/tmp/123.npz')
    >>> data['a']
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> data['b']
    array([1, 2])
    >>> data.close()

    Mem-map the stored array, and then access the second row
    directly from disk:

    >>> X = np.load('/tmp/123.npy', mmap_mode='r')
    >>> X[1, :]
    memmap([4, 5, 6])

    ZipFileFailed to write to %s: %sPKWriteWrap
    Save several arrays into a single file in compressed ``.npz`` format.

    If keyword arguments are given, then filenames are taken from the keywords.
    If arguments are passed in with no keywords, then stored file names are
    arr_0, arr_1, etc.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file : str or file
        Either the file name (string) or an open file (file-like object)
        where the data will be saved. If file is a string or a Path, the
        ``.npz`` extension will be appended to the file name if it is not
        already there.
    args : Arguments, optional
        Arrays to save to the file. Since it is not possible for Python to
        know the names of the arrays outside `savez`, the arrays will be saved
        with names "arr_0", "arr_1", and so on. These arguments can be any
        expression.
    kwds : Keyword arguments, optional
        Arrays to save to the file. Arrays will be saved in the file with the
        keyword names.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.save : Save a single array to a binary file in NumPy format.
    numpy.savetxt : Save an array to a file as plain text.
    numpy.savez : Save several arrays into an uncompressed ``.npz`` file format
    numpy.load : Load the files created by savez_compressed.

    Notes
    -----
    The ``.npz`` file format is a zipped archive of files named after the
    variables they contain.  The archive is compressed with
    ``zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED`` and each file in the archive contains one variable
    in ``.npy`` format. For a description of the ``.npy`` format, see 
    :py:mod:`numpy.lib.format`.


    When opening the saved ``.npz`` file with `load` a `NpzFile` object is
    returned. This is a dictionary-like object which can be queried for
    its list of arrays (with the ``.files`` attribute), and for the arrays
    themselves.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> test_array = np.random.rand(3, 2)
    >>> test_vector = np.random.rand(4)
    >>> np.savez_compressed('/tmp/123', a=test_array, b=test_vector)
    >>> loaded = np.load('/tmp/123.npz')
    >>> print(np.array_equal(test_array, loaded['a']))
    True
    >>> print(np.array_equal(test_vector, loaded['b']))
    True

    Construct an array from a text file, using regular expression parsing.

    The returned array is always a structured array, and is constructed from
    all matches of the regular expression in the file. Groups in the regular
    expression are converted to fields of the structured array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file : str or file
        File name or file object to read.
    regexp : str or regexp
        Regular expression used to parse the file.
        Groups in the regular expression correspond to fields in the dtype.
    dtype : dtype or list of dtypes
        Dtype for the structured array.
    encoding : str, optional
        Encoding used to decode the inputfile. Does not apply to input streams.

        .. versionadded:: 1.14.0

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        The output array, containing the part of the content of `file` that
        was matched by `regexp`. `output` is always a structured array.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        When `dtype` is not a valid dtype for a structured array.

    See Also
    --------
    fromstring, loadtxt

    Notes
    -----
    Dtypes for structured arrays can be specified in several forms, but all
    forms specify at least the data type and field name. For details see
    `doc.structured_arrays`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> f = open('test.dat', 'w')
    >>> f.write("1312 foo\n1534  bar\n444   qux")
    >>> f.close()

    >>> regexp = r"(\d+)\s+(...)"  # match [digits, whitespace, anything]
    >>> output = np.fromregex('test.dat', regexp,
    ...                       [('num', np.int64), ('key', 'S3')])
    >>> output
    array([(1312L, 'foo'), (1534L, 'bar'), (444L, 'qux')],
          dtype=[('num', '<i8'), ('key', '|S3')])
    >>> output['num']
    array([1312, 1534,  444], dtype=int64)

    BagObj.__dir__Convert to unicode in py2 or to bytes on bytestream inputs.

        
    Load data from a text file, with missing values handled as specified.

    Each line past the first `skip_header` lines is split at the `delimiter`
    character, and characters following the `comments` character are discarded.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : file, str, pathlib.Path, list of str, generator
        File, filename, list, or generator to read.  If the filename
        extension is `.gz` or `.bz2`, the file is first decompressed. Note
        that generators must return byte strings in Python 3k.  The strings
        in a list or produced by a generator are treated as lines.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Data type of the resulting array.
        If None, the dtypes will be determined by the contents of each
        column, individually.
    comments : str, optional
        The character used to indicate the start of a comment.
        All the characters occurring on a line after a comment are discarded
    delimiter : str, int, or sequence, optional
        The string used to separate values.  By default, any consecutive
        whitespaces act as delimiter.  An integer or sequence of integers
        can also be provided as width(s) of each field.
    skiprows : int, optional
        `skiprows` was removed in numpy 1.10. Please use `skip_header` instead.
    skip_header : int, optional
        The number of lines to skip at the beginning of the file.
    skip_footer : int, optional
        The number of lines to skip at the end of the file.
    converters : variable, optional
        The set of functions that convert the data of a column to a value.
        The converters can also be used to provide a default value
        for missing data: ``converters = {3: lambda s: float(s or 0)}``.
    missing : variable, optional
        `missing` was removed in numpy 1.10. Please use `missing_values`
        instead.
    missing_values : variable, optional
        The set of strings corresponding to missing data.
    filling_values : variable, optional
        The set of values to be used as default when the data are missing.
    usecols : sequence, optional
        Which columns to read, with 0 being the first.  For example,
        ``usecols = (1, 4, 5)`` will extract the 2nd, 5th and 6th columns.
    names : {None, True, str, sequence}, optional
        If `names` is True, the field names are read from the first line after
        the first `skip_header` lines.  This line can optionally be proceeded
        by a comment delimiter. If `names` is a sequence or a single-string of
        comma-separated names, the names will be used to define the field names
        in a structured dtype. If `names` is None, the names of the dtype
        fields will be used, if any.
    excludelist : sequence, optional
        A list of names to exclude. This list is appended to the default list
        ['return','file','print']. Excluded names are appended an underscore:
        for example, `file` would become `file_`.
    deletechars : str, optional
        A string combining invalid characters that must be deleted from the
        names.
    defaultfmt : str, optional
        A format used to define default field names, such as "f%i" or "f_%02i".
    autostrip : bool, optional
        Whether to automatically strip white spaces from the variables.
    replace_space : char, optional
        Character(s) used in replacement of white spaces in the variables
        names. By default, use a '_'.
    case_sensitive : {True, False, 'upper', 'lower'}, optional
        If True, field names are case sensitive.
        If False or 'upper', field names are converted to upper case.
        If 'lower', field names are converted to lower case.
    unpack : bool, optional
        If True, the returned array is transposed, so that arguments may be
        unpacked using ``x, y, z = loadtxt(...)``
    usemask : bool, optional
        If True, return a masked array.
        If False, return a regular array.
    loose : bool, optional
        If True, do not raise errors for invalid values.
    invalid_raise : bool, optional
        If True, an exception is raised if an inconsistency is detected in the
        number of columns.
        If False, a warning is emitted and the offending lines are skipped.
    max_rows : int,  optional
        The maximum number of rows to read. Must not be used with skip_footer
        at the same time.  If given, the value must be at least 1. Default is
        to read the entire file.

        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0
    encoding : str, optional
        Encoding used to decode the inputfile. Does not apply when `fname` is
        a file object.  The special value 'bytes' enables backward compatibility
        workarounds that ensure that you receive byte arrays when possible
        and passes latin1 encoded strings to converters. Override this value to
        receive unicode arrays and pass strings as input to converters.  If set
        to None the system default is used. The default value is 'bytes'.

        .. versionadded:: 1.14.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Data read from the text file. If `usemask` is True, this is a
        masked array.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.loadtxt : equivalent function when no data is missing.

    Notes
    -----
    * When spaces are used as delimiters, or when no delimiter has been given
      as input, there should not be any missing data between two fields.
    * When the variables are named (either by a flexible dtype or with `names`,
      there must not be any header in the file (else a ValueError
      exception is raised).
    * Individual values are not stripped of spaces by default.
      When using a custom converter, make sure the function does remove spaces.

    archive provided on construction.

    `NpzFile` is used to load files in the NumPy ``.npz`` data archive
    format. It assumes that files in the archive have a ``.npy`` extension,
    other files are ignored.

    The arrays and file strings are lazily loaded on either
    getitem access using ``obj['key']`` or attribute lookup using
    ``obj.f.key``. A list of all files (without ``.npy`` extensions) can
    be obtained with ``obj.files`` and the ZipFile object itself using
    ``obj.zip``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    files : list of str
        List of all files in the archive with a ``.npy`` extension.
    zip : ZipFile instance
        The ZipFile object initialized with the zipped archive.
    f : BagObj instance
        An object on which attribute can be performed as an alternative
        to getitem access on the `NpzFile` instance itself.
    allow_pickle : bool, optional
        Allow loading pickled data. Default: False

        .. versionchanged:: 1.16.3
            Made default False in response to CVE-2019-6446.

    pickle_kwargs : dict, optional
        Additional keyword arguments to pass on to pickle.load.
        These are only useful when loading object arrays saved on
        Python 2 when using Python 3.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fid : file or str
        The zipped archive to open. This is either a file-like object
        or a string containing the path to the archive.
    own_fid : bool, optional
        Whether NpzFile should close the file handle.
        Requires that `fid` is a file-like object.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    >>> outfile = TemporaryFile()
    >>> x = np.arange(10)
    >>> y = np.sin(x)
    >>> np.savez(outfile, x=x, y=y)
    >>> outfile.seek(0)

    >>> npz = np.load(outfile)
    >>> isinstance(npz, np.lib.io.NpzFile)
    True
    >>> npz.files
    ['y', 'x']
    >>> npz['x']  # getitem access
    array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
    >>> npz.f.x  # attribute lookup
    array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

    'max_rows' must be at least 1.Pack items into nested lists based on re-packing info.%s is not a file in the archiveown_fh
    Load ASCII data stored in a comma-separated file.

    The returned array is a record array (if ``usemask=False``, see
    `recarray`) or a masked record array (if ``usemask=True``,
    see `ma.mrecords.MaskedRecords`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname, kwargs : For a description of input parameters, see `genfromtxt`.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.genfromtxt : generic function to load ASCII data.

    Notes
    -----
    By default, `dtype` is None, which means that the data-type of the output
    array will be determined from the data.

    Save several arrays into a single file in uncompressed ``.npz`` format.

    If arguments are passed in with no keywords, the corresponding variable
    names, in the ``.npz`` file, are 'arr_0', 'arr_1', etc. If keyword
    arguments are given, the corresponding variable names, in the ``.npz``
    file will match the keyword names.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file : str or file
        Either the file name (string) or an open file (file-like object)
        where the data will be saved. If file is a string or a Path, the
        ``.npz`` extension will be appended to the file name if it is not
        already there.
    args : Arguments, optional
        Arrays to save to the file. Since it is not possible for Python to
        know the names of the arrays outside `savez`, the arrays will be saved
        with names "arr_0", "arr_1", and so on. These arguments can be any
        expression.
    kwds : Keyword arguments, optional
        Arrays to save to the file. Arrays will be saved in the file with the
        keyword names.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    See Also
    --------
    save : Save a single array to a binary file in NumPy format.
    savetxt : Save an array to a file as plain text.
    savez_compressed : Save several arrays into a compressed ``.npz`` archive

    Notes
    -----
    The ``.npz`` file format is a zipped archive of files named after the
    variables they contain.  The archive is not compressed and each file
    in the archive contains one variable in ``.npy`` format. For a
    description of the ``.npy`` format, see :py:mod:`numpy.lib.format`.

    When opening the saved ``.npz`` file with `load` a `NpzFile` object is
    returned. This is a dictionary-like object which can be queried for
    its list of arrays (with the ``.files`` attribute), and for the arrays
    themselves.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    >>> outfile = TemporaryFile()
    >>> x = np.arange(10)
    >>> y = np.sin(x)

    Using `savez` with \*args, the arrays are saved with default names.

    >>> np.savez(outfile, x, y)
    >>> outfile.seek(0) # Only needed here to simulate closing & reopening file
    >>> npzfile = np.load(outfile)
    >>> npzfile.files
    ['arr_1', 'arr_0']
    >>> npzfile['arr_0']
    array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

    Using `savez` with \**kwds, the arrays are saved with the keyword names.

    >>> outfile = TemporaryFile()
    >>> np.savez(outfile, x=x, y=y)
    >>> outfile.seek(0)
    >>> npzfile = np.load(outfile)
    >>> npzfile.files
    ['y', 'x']
    >>> npzfile['x']
    array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

    Load data from a text file.

    Each row in the text file must have the same number of values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : file, str, or pathlib.Path
        File, filename, or generator to read.  If the filename extension is
        ``.gz`` or ``.bz2``, the file is first decompressed. Note that
        generators should return byte strings for Python 3k.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Data-type of the resulting array; default: float.  If this is a
        structured data-type, the resulting array will be 1-dimensional, and
        each row will be interpreted as an element of the array.  In this
        case, the number of columns used must match the number of fields in
        the data-type.
    comments : str or sequence of str, optional
        The characters or list of characters used to indicate the start of a
        comment. None implies no comments. For backwards compatibility, byte
        strings will be decoded as 'latin1'. The default is '#'.
    delimiter : str, optional
        The string used to separate values. For backwards compatibility, byte
        strings will be decoded as 'latin1'. The default is whitespace.
    converters : dict, optional
        A dictionary mapping column number to a function that will parse the
        column string into the desired value.  E.g., if column 0 is a date
        string: ``converters = {0: datestr2num}``.  Converters can also be
        used to provide a default value for missing data (but see also
        `genfromtxt`): ``converters = {3: lambda s: float(s.strip() or 0)}``.
        Default: None.
    skiprows : int, optional
        Skip the first `skiprows` lines; default: 0.
    usecols : int or sequence, optional
        Which columns to read, with 0 being the first. For example,
        ``usecols = (1,4,5)`` will extract the 2nd, 5th and 6th columns.
        The default, None, results in all columns being read.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.11.0
            When a single column has to be read it is possible to use
            an integer instead of a tuple. E.g ``usecols = 3`` reads the
            fourth column the same way as ``usecols = (3,)`` would.
    unpack : bool, optional
        If True, the returned array is transposed, so that arguments may be
        unpacked using ``x, y, z = loadtxt(...)``.  When used with a structured
        data-type, arrays are returned for each field.  Default is False.
    ndmin : int, optional
        The returned array will have at least `ndmin` dimensions.
        Otherwise mono-dimensional axes will be squeezed.
        Legal values: 0 (default), 1 or 2.

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0
    encoding : str, optional
        Encoding used to decode the inputfile. Does not apply to input streams.
        The special value 'bytes' enables backward compatibility workarounds
        that ensures you receive byte arrays as results if possible and passes
        'latin1' encoded strings to converters. Override this value to receive
        unicode arrays and pass strings as input to converters.  If set to None
        the system default is used. The default value is 'bytes'.

        .. versionadded:: 1.14.0
    max_rows : int, optional
        Read `max_rows` lines of content after `skiprows` lines. The default
        is to read all the lines.

        .. versionadded:: 1.16.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Data read from the text file.

    See Also
    --------
    load, fromstring, fromregex
    genfromtxt : Load data with missing values handled as specified.
    scipy.io.loadmat : reads MATLAB data files

    Notes
    -----
    This function aims to be a fast reader for simply formatted files.  The
    `genfromtxt` function provides more sophisticated handling of, e.g.,
    lines with missing values.

    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    The strings produced by the Python float.hex method can be used as
    input for floats.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from io import StringIO   # StringIO behaves like a file object
    >>> c = StringIO(u"0 1\n2 3")
    >>> np.loadtxt(c)
    array([[ 0.,  1.],
           [ 2.,  3.]])

    >>> d = StringIO(u"M 21 72\nF 35 58")
    >>> np.loadtxt(d, dtype={'names': ('gender', 'age', 'weight'),
    ...                      'formats': ('S1', 'i4', 'f4')})
    array([('M', 21, 72.0), ('F', 35, 58.0)],
          dtype=[('gender', '|S1'), ('age', '<i4'), ('weight', '<f4')])

    >>> c = StringIO(u"1,0,2\n3,0,4")
    >>> x, y = np.loadtxt(c, delimiter=',', usecols=(0, 2), unpack=True)
    >>> x
    array([ 1.,  3.])
    >>> y
    array([ 2.,  4.])

    zipfile_factoryNpzFile.iterkeys is deprecated in python 3, to match the removal of dict.iterkeys. Use .keys() instead.
    Save an array to a binary file in NumPy ``.npy`` format.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file : file, str, or pathlib.Path
        File or filename to which the data is saved.  If file is a file-object,
        then the filename is unchanged.  If file is a string or Path, a ``.npy``
        extension will be appended to the file name if it does not already
        have one.
    arr : array_like
        Array data to be saved.
    allow_pickle : bool, optional
        Allow saving object arrays using Python pickles. Reasons for disallowing
        pickles include security (loading pickled data can execute arbitrary
        code) and portability (pickled objects may not be loadable on different
        Python installations, for example if the stored objects require libraries
        that are not available, and not all pickled data is compatible between
        Python 2 and Python 3).
        Default: True
    fix_imports : bool, optional
        Only useful in forcing objects in object arrays on Python 3 to be
        pickled in a Python 2 compatible way. If `fix_imports` is True, pickle
        will try to map the new Python 3 names to the old module names used in
        Python 2, so that the pickle data stream is readable with Python 2.

    Load ASCII data from a file and return it in a record array.

    If ``usemask=False`` a standard `recarray` is returned,
    if ``usemask=True`` a MaskedRecords array is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname, kwargs : For a description of input parameters, see `genfromtxt`.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.genfromtxt : generic function

    Notes
    -----
    By default, `dtype` is None, which means that the data-type of the output
    array will be determined from the data.

    
    Save an array to a text file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : filename or file handle
        If the filename ends in ``.gz``, the file is automatically saved in
        compressed gzip format.  `loadtxt` understands gzipped files
        transparently.
    X : 1D or 2D array_like
        Data to be saved to a text file.
    fmt : str or sequence of strs, optional
        A single format (%10.5f), a sequence of formats, or a
        multi-format string, e.g. 'Iteration %d -- %10.5f', in which
        case `delimiter` is ignored. For complex `X`, the legal options
        for `fmt` are:

        * a single specifier, `fmt='%.4e'`, resulting in numbers formatted
          like `' (%s+%sj)' % (fmt, fmt)`
        * a full string specifying every real and imaginary part, e.g.
          `' %.4e %+.4ej %.4e %+.4ej %.4e %+.4ej'` for 3 columns
        * a list of specifiers, one per column - in this case, the real
          and imaginary part must have separate specifiers,
          e.g. `['%.3e + %.3ej', '(%.15e%+.15ej)']` for 2 columns
    delimiter : str, optional
        String or character separating columns.
    newline : str, optional
        String or character separating lines.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5.0
    header : str, optional
        String that will be written at the beginning of the file.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
    footer : str, optional
        String that will be written at the end of the file.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
    comments : str, optional
        String that will be prepended to the ``header`` and ``footer`` strings,
        to mark them as comments. Default: '# ',  as expected by e.g.
        ``numpy.loadtxt``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
    encoding : {None, str}, optional
        Encoding used to encode the outputfile. Does not apply to output
        streams. If the encoding is something other than 'bytes' or 'latin1'
        you will not be able to load the file in NumPy versions < 1.14. Default
        is 'latin1'.

    Least squares polynomial fit.

    Fit a polynomial ``p(x) = p[0] * x**deg + ... + p[deg]`` of degree `deg`
    to points `(x, y)`. Returns a vector of coefficients `p` that minimises
    the squared error in the order `deg`, `deg-1`, ... `0`.

    The `Polynomial.fit <numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial.fit>` class
    method is recommended for new code as it is more stable numerically. See
    the documentation of the method for more information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (M,)
        x-coordinates of the M sample points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
    y : array_like, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        y-coordinates of the sample points. Several data sets of sample
        points sharing the same x-coordinates can be fitted at once by
        passing in a 2D-array that contains one dataset per column.
    deg : int
        Degree of the fitting polynomial
    rcond : float, optional
        Relative condition number of the fit. Singular values smaller than
        this relative to the largest singular value will be ignored. The
        default value is len(x)*eps, where eps is the relative precision of
        the float type, about 2e-16 in most cases.
    full : bool, optional
        Switch determining nature of return value. When it is False (the
        default) just the coefficients are returned, when True diagnostic
        information from the singular value decomposition is also returned.
    w : array_like, shape (M,), optional
        Weights to apply to the y-coordinates of the sample points. For
        gaussian uncertainties, use 1/sigma (not 1/sigma**2).
    cov : bool or str, optional
        If given and not `False`, return not just the estimate but also its
        covariance matrix. By default, the covariance are scaled by
        chi2/sqrt(N-dof), i.e., the weights are presumed to be unreliable
        except in a relative sense and everything is scaled such that the
        reduced chi2 is unity. This scaling is omitted if ``cov='unscaled'``,
        as is relevant for the case that the weights are 1/sigma**2, with
        sigma known to be a reliable estimate of the uncertainty.

    Returns
    -------
    p : ndarray, shape (deg + 1,) or (deg + 1, K)
        Polynomial coefficients, highest power first.  If `y` was 2-D, the
        coefficients for `k`-th data set are in ``p[:,k]``.

    residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond
        Present only if `full` = True.  Residuals of the least-squares fit,
        the effective rank of the scaled Vandermonde coefficient matrix,

    Warns
    -----
    RankWarning
        The rank of the coefficient matrix in the least-squares fit is
        deficient. The warning is only raised if `full` = False.

        The warnings can be turned off by

        >>> import warnings
        >>> warnings.simplefilter('ignore', np.RankWarning)

    Notes
    -----
    The solution minimizes the squared error

    .. math ::
        E = \sum_{j=0}^k |p(x_j) - y_j|^2

    in the equations::

        x[0]**n * p[0] + ... + x[0] * p[n-1] + p[n] = y[0]
        x[1]**n * p[0] + ... + x[1] * p[n-1] + p[n] = y[1]
        ...
        x[k]**n * p[0] + ... + x[k] * p[n-1] + p[n] = y[k]

    The coefficient matrix of the coefficients `p` is a Vandermonde matrix.

    `polyfit` issues a `RankWarning` when the least-squares fit is badly
    conditioned. This implies that the best fit is not well-defined due
    to numerical error. The results may be improved by lowering the polynomial
    degree or by replacing `x` by `x` - `x`.mean(). The `rcond` parameter
    can also be set to a value smaller than its default, but the resulting
    fit may be spurious: including contributions from the small singular
    values can add numerical noise to the result.

    Note that fitting polynomial coefficients is inherently badly conditioned
    when the degree of the polynomial is large or the interval of sample points
    is badly centered. The quality of the fit should always be checked in these
    cases. When polynomial fits are not satisfactory, splines may be a good
    alternative.

    Find the coefficients of a polynomial with the given sequence of roots.

    Returns the coefficients of the polynomial whose leading coefficient
    is one for the given sequence of zeros (multiple roots must be included
    in the sequence as many times as their multiplicity; see Examples).
    A square matrix (or array, which will be treated as a matrix) can also
    be given, in which case the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial
    of the matrix are returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seq_of_zeros : array_like, shape (N,) or (N, N)
        A sequence of polynomial roots, or a square array or matrix object.

    Returns
    -------

        1D array of polynomial coefficients from highest to lowest degree:

        ``c[0] * x**(N) + c[1] * x**(N-1) + ... + c[N-1] * x + c[N]``
        where c[0] always equals 1.

    Raises
    ------

        2-D array).

    Notes
    -----
    Specifying the roots of a polynomial still leaves one degree of
    freedom, typically represented by an undetermined leading
    coefficient. [1]_ In the case of this function, that coefficient -
    the first one in the returned array - is always taken as one. (If
    for some reason you have one other point, the only automatic way
    presently to leverage that information is to use ``polyfit``.)

    The characteristic polynomial, :math:`p_a(t)`, of an `n`-by-`n`
    matrix **A** is given by

        :math:`p_a(t) = \mathrm{det}(t\, \mathbf{I} - \mathbf{A})`,

    where **I** is the `n`-by-`n` identity matrix. [2]_

    Return an antiderivative (indefinite integral) of a polynomial.

    The returned order `m` antiderivative `P` of polynomial `p` satisfies
    :math:`\frac{d^m}{dx^m}P(x) = p(x)` and is defined up to `m - 1`
    integration constants `k`. The constants determine the low-order
    polynomial part

    .. math:: \frac{k_{m-1}}{0!} x^0 + \ldots + \frac{k_0}{(m-1)!}x^{m-1}

    of `P` so that :math:`P^{(j)}(0) = k_{m-j-1}`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : array_like or poly1d
        Polynomial to integrate.
        A sequence is interpreted as polynomial coefficients, see `poly1d`.
    m : int, optional
        Order of the antiderivative. (Default: 1)
    k : list of `m` scalars or scalar, optional
        Integration constants. They are given in the order of integration:
        those corresponding to highest-order terms come first.

        If ``None`` (default), all constants are assumed to be zero.
        If `m = 1`, a single scalar can be given instead of a list.

    --------
    The defining property of the antiderivative:

    >>> p = np.poly1d([1,1,1])
    >>> P = np.polyint(p)
    >>> P
    poly1d([ 0.33333333,  0.5       ,  1.        ,  0.        ])
    >>> np.polyder(P) == p
    True

    The integration constants default to zero, but can be specified:

    >>> P = np.polyint(p, 3)
    >>> P(0)
    0.0
    >>> np.polyder(P)(0)
    0.0
    >>> np.polyder(P, 2)(0)
    0.0
    >>> P = np.polyint(p, 3, k=[6,5,3])
    >>> P
    poly1d([ 0.01666667,  0.04166667,  0.16666667,  3. ,  5. ,  3. ])

    Note that 3 = 6 / 2!, and that the constants are given in the order of
    integrations. Constant of the highest-order polynomial term comes first:

    >>> np.polyder(P, 2)(0)
    6.0
    >>> np.polyder(P, 1)(0)
    5.0
    >>> P(0)
    3.0

    NX
    Evaluate a polynomial at specific values.

    If `p` is of length N, this function returns the value:

        ``p[0]*x**(N-1) + p[1]*x**(N-2) + ... + p[N-2]*x + p[N-1]``

    If `x` is a sequence, then `p(x)` is returned for each element of `x`.
    If `x` is another polynomial then the composite polynomial `p(x(t))`
    is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : array_like or poly1d object
       1D array of polynomial coefficients (including coefficients equal
       to zero) from highest degree to the constant term, or an
       instance of poly1d.
    x : array_like or poly1d object
       A number, an array of numbers, or an instance of poly1d, at
       which to evaluate `p`.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray or poly1d
       If `x` is a poly1d instance, the result is the composition of the two
       polynomials, i.e., `x` is "substituted" in `p` and the simplified
       result is returned. In addition, the type of `x` - array_like or
       poly1d - governs the type of the output: `x` array_like => `values`
       array_like, `x` a poly1d object => `values` is also.

    --------
    poly1d: A polynomial class.

    Notes
    -----
    Horner's scheme [1]_ is used to evaluate the polynomial. Even so,
    for polynomials of high degree the values may be inaccurate due to
    rounding errors. Use carefully.

        If True, `c_or_r` specifies the polynomial's roots; the default
        is False.
    variable : str, optional
        Changes the variable used when printing `p` from `x` to `variable`
        (see Examples).

    Examples
    --------
    Construct the polynomial :math:`x^2 + 2x + 3`:

    >>> p = np.poly1d([1, 2, 3])
    >>> print(np.poly1d(p))
       2
    1 x + 2 x + 3

    Evaluate the polynomial at :math:`x = 0.5`:

    >>> p(0.5)
    4.25

    Find the roots:

    >>> p.r
    array([-1.+1.41421356j, -1.-1.41421356j])
    >>> p(p.r)
    array([ -4.44089210e-16+0.j,  -4.44089210e-16+0.j])

    These numbers in the previous line represent (0, 0) to machine precision

    Show the coefficients:

    >>> p.c
    array([1, 2, 3])

    Display the order (the leading zero-coefficients are removed):

    >>> p.order
    2

    Show the coefficient of the k-th power in the polynomial
    (which is equivalent to ``p.c[-(i+1)]``):

    >>> p[1]
    2

    Polynomials can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided
    (returns quotient and remainder):

    >>> p * p
    poly1d([ 1,  4, 10, 12,  9])

    >>> (p**3 + 4) / p
    (poly1d([  1.,   4.,  10.,  12.,   9.]), poly1d([ 4.]))

    ``asarray(p)`` gives the coefficient array, so polynomials can be
    used in all functions that accept arrays:

    >>> p**2 # square of polynomial
    poly1d([ 1,  4, 10, 12,  9])

    >>> np.square(p) # square of individual coefficients
    array([1, 4, 9])

    The variable used in the string representation of `p` can be modified,
    using the `variable` parameter:

    >>> p = np.poly1d([1,2,3], variable='z')
    >>> print(p)
       2
    1 z + 2 z + 3

    Construct a polynomial from its roots:

    >>> np.poly1d([1, 2], True)
    poly1d([ 1, -3,  2])

    This is the same polynomial as obtained by:

    >>> np.poly1d([1, -1]) * np.poly1d([1, -2])
    poly1d([ 1, -3,  2])

    Compute the logarithm base 2 of `x`.

    Return the "principal value" (for a description of this, see
    `numpy.log2`) of :math:`log_2(x)`. For real `x > 0`, this is
    a real number (``log2(0)`` returns ``-inf`` and ``log2(np.inf)`` returns
    ``inf``). Otherwise, the complex principle value is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
       The value(s) whose log base 2 is (are) required.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
       The log base 2 of the `x` value(s). If `x` was a scalar, so is `out`,
       otherwise an array is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.log2

    Notes
    -----
    For a log2() that returns ``NAN`` when real `x < 0`, use `numpy.log2`
    (note, however, that otherwise `numpy.log2` and this `log2` are
    identical, i.e., both return ``-inf`` for `x = 0`, ``inf`` for `x = inf`,
    and, notably, the complex principle value if ``x.imag != 0``).

    Examples
    --------
    We set the printing precision so the example can be auto-tested:

    >>> np.set_printoptions(precision=4)

    >>> np.emath.log2(8)
    3.0
    >>> np.emath.log2([-4, -8, 8])
    array([ 2.+4.5324j,  3.+4.5324j,  3.+0.j    ])

    lognConvert its input `arr` to a complex array.

    The input is returned as a complex array of the smallest type that will fit
    the original data: types like single, byte, short, etc. become csingle,
    while others become cdouble.

    A copy of the input is always made.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array

    Returns
    -------
    array
        An array with the same input data as the input but in complex form.

    Examples
    --------

    First, consider an input of type short:

    >>> a = np.array([1,2,3],np.short)

    >>> ac = np.lib.scimath._tocomplex(a); ac
    array([ 1.+0.j,  2.+0.j,  3.+0.j], dtype=complex64)

    >>> ac.dtype
    dtype('complex64')

    If the input is of type double, the output is correspondingly of the
    complex double type as well:

    >>> b = np.array([1,2,3],np.double)

    >>> bc = np.lib.scimath._tocomplex(b); bc
    array([ 1.+0.j,  2.+0.j,  3.+0.j])

    >>> bc.dtype
    dtype('complex128')

    Note that even if the input was complex to begin with, a copy is still
    made, since the astype() method always copies:

    >>> c = np.array([1,2,3],np.csingle)

    >>> cc = np.lib.scimath._tocomplex(c); cc
    array([ 1.+0.j,  2.+0.j,  3.+0.j], dtype=complex64)

    >>> c *= 2; c
    array([ 2.+0.j,  4.+0.j,  6.+0.j], dtype=complex64)

    >>> cc
    array([ 1.+0.j,  2.+0.j,  3.+0.j], dtype=complex64)
    numpy.lib.scimath<module numpy.lib.scimath>Convert `x` to complex if it has real, negative components.

    Otherwise, output is just the array version of the input (via asarray).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like

    Returns
    -------
    array

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.lib.scimath._fix_real_lt_zero([1,2])
    array([1, 2])

    >>> np.lib.scimath._fix_real_lt_zero([-1,2])
    array([-1.+0.j,  2.+0.j])

    
    Return x to the power p, (x**p).

    If `x` contains negative values, the output is converted to the
    complex domain.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The input value(s).
    p : array_like of ints
        The power(s) to which `x` is raised. If `x` contains multiple values,
        `p` has to either be a scalar, or contain the same number of values
        as `x`. In the latter case, the result is
        ``x[0]**p[0], x[1]**p[1], ...``.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
        The result of ``x**p``. If `x` and `p` are scalars, so is `out`,
        otherwise an array is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.power

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.set_printoptions(precision=4)

    >>> np.lib.scimath.power([2, 4], 2)
    array([ 4, 16])
    >>> np.lib.scimath.power([2, 4], -2)
    array([ 0.25  ,  0.0625])
    >>> np.lib.scimath.power([-2, 4], 2)
    array([  4.+0.j,  16.+0.j])

    
    Compute the natural logarithm of `x`.

    Return the "principal value" (for a description of this, see `numpy.log`)
    of :math:`log_e(x)`. For real `x > 0`, this is a real number (``log(0)``
    returns ``-inf`` and ``log(np.inf)`` returns ``inf``). Otherwise, the
    complex principle value is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
       The value(s) whose log is (are) required.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
       The log of the `x` value(s). If `x` was a scalar, so is `out`,
       otherwise an array is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.log

    Notes
    -----
    For a log() that returns ``NAN`` when real `x < 0`, use `numpy.log`
    (note, however, that otherwise `numpy.log` and this `log` are identical,
    i.e., both return ``-inf`` for `x = 0`, ``inf`` for `x = inf`, and,
    notably, the complex principle value if ``x.imag != 0``).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.emath.log(np.exp(1))
    1.0

    Negative arguments are handled "correctly" (recall that
    ``exp(log(x)) == x`` does *not* hold for real ``x < 0``):

    >>> np.emath.log(-np.exp(1)) == (1 + np.pi * 1j)
    True

    
    Compute the inverse cosine of x.

    Return the "principal value" (for a description of this, see
    `numpy.arccos`) of the inverse cosine of `x`. For real `x` such that
    `abs(x) <= 1`, this is a real number in the closed interval
    :math:`[0, \pi]`.  Otherwise, the complex principle value is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like or scalar
       The value(s) whose arccos is (are) required.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
       The inverse cosine(s) of the `x` value(s). If `x` was a scalar, so
       is `out`, otherwise an array object is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.arccos

    Notes
    -----
    For an arccos() that returns ``NAN`` when real `x` is not in the
    interval ``[-1,1]``, use `numpy.arccos`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.set_printoptions(precision=4)

    >>> np.emath.arccos(1) # a scalar is returned
    0.0

    >>> np.emath.arccos([1,2])
    array([ 0.-0.j   ,  0.+1.317j])

    _fix_int_lt_zero_ln2
    Compute the inverse hyperbolic tangent of `x`.

    Return the "principal value" (for a description of this, see
    `numpy.arctanh`) of `arctanh(x)`. For real `x` such that
    `abs(x) < 1`, this is a real number.  If `abs(x) > 1`, or if `x` is
    complex, the result is complex. Finally, `x = 1` returns``inf`` and
    `x=-1` returns ``-inf``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
       The value(s) whose arctanh is (are) required.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
       The inverse hyperbolic tangent(s) of the `x` value(s). If `x` was
       a scalar so is `out`, otherwise an array is returned.


    See Also
    --------
    numpy.arctanh

    Notes
    -----
    For an arctanh() that returns ``NAN`` when real `x` is not in the
    interval ``(-1,1)``, use `numpy.arctanh` (this latter, however, does
    return +/-inf for `x = +/-1`).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.set_printoptions(precision=4)

    >>> np.emath.arctanh(np.eye(2))
    array([[ Inf,   0.],
           [  0.,  Inf]])
    >>> np.emath.arctanh([1j])
    array([ 0.+0.7854j])

    _power_dispatcher_logn_dispatcherConvert `x` to double if it has real, negative components.

    Otherwise, output is just the array version of the input (via asarray).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like

    Returns
    -------
    array

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.lib.scimath._fix_int_lt_zero([1,2])
    array([1, 2])

    >>> np.lib.scimath._fix_int_lt_zero([-1,2])
    array([-1.,  2.])
    
Wrapper functions to more user-friendly calling of certain math functions
whose output data-type is different than the input data-type in certain
domains of the input.

For example, for functions like `log` with branch cuts, the versions in this
module provide the mathematically valid answers in the complex plane::

  >>> import math
  >>> from numpy.lib import scimath
  >>> scimath.log(-math.exp(1)) == (1+1j*math.pi)
  True

Similarly, `sqrt`, other base logarithms, `power` and trig functions are
correctly handled.  See their respective docstrings for specific examples.

Convert `x` to complex if it has real components x_i with abs(x_i)>1.

    Otherwise, output is just the array version of the input (via asarray).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like

    Returns
    -------
    array

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.lib.scimath._fix_real_abs_gt_1([0,1])
    array([0, 1])

    >>> np.lib.scimath._fix_real_abs_gt_1([0,2])
    array([ 0.+0.j,  2.+0.j])
    
    Compute the logarithm base 10 of `x`.

    Return the "principal value" (for a description of this, see
    `numpy.log10`) of :math:`log_{10}(x)`. For real `x > 0`, this
    is a real number (``log10(0)`` returns ``-inf`` and ``log10(np.inf)``
    returns ``inf``). Otherwise, the complex principle value is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like or scalar
       The value(s) whose log base 10 is (are) required.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
       The log base 10 of the `x` value(s). If `x` was a scalar, so is `out`,
       otherwise an array object is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.log10

    Notes
    -----
    For a log10() that returns ``NAN`` when real `x < 0`, use `numpy.log10`
    (note, however, that otherwise `numpy.log10` and this `log10` are
    identical, i.e., both return ``-inf`` for `x = 0`, ``inf`` for `x = inf`,
    and, notably, the complex principle value if ``x.imag != 0``).

    Examples
    --------

    (We set the printing precision so the example can be auto-tested)

    >>> np.set_printoptions(precision=4)

    >>> np.emath.log10(10**1)
    1.0

    >>> np.emath.log10([-10**1, -10**2, 10**2])
    array([ 1.+1.3644j,  2.+1.3644j,  2.+0.j    ])

    /home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/lib/scimath.py
    Compute the inverse sine of x.

    Return the "principal value" (for a description of this, see
    `numpy.arcsin`) of the inverse sine of `x`. For real `x` such that
    `abs(x) <= 1`, this is a real number in the closed interval
    :math:`[-\pi/2, \pi/2]`.  Otherwise, the complex principle value is
    returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like or scalar
       The value(s) whose arcsin is (are) required.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
       The inverse sine(s) of the `x` value(s). If `x` was a scalar, so
       is `out`, otherwise an array object is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.arcsin

    Notes
    -----
    For an arcsin() that returns ``NAN`` when real `x` is not in the
    interval ``[-1,1]``, use `numpy.arcsin`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.set_printoptions(precision=4)

    >>> np.emath.arcsin(0)
    0.0

    >>> np.emath.arcsin([0,1])
    array([ 0.    ,  1.5708])

    
    Compute the square root of x.

    For negative input elements, a complex value is returned
    (unlike `numpy.sqrt` which returns NaN).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
       The input value(s).

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
       The square root of `x`. If `x` was a scalar, so is `out`,
       otherwise an array is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.sqrt

    Examples
    --------
    For real, non-negative inputs this works just like `numpy.sqrt`:

    >>> np.lib.scimath.sqrt(1)
    1.0
    >>> np.lib.scimath.sqrt([1, 4])
    array([ 1.,  2.])

    But it automatically handles negative inputs:

    >>> np.lib.scimath.sqrt(-1)
    (0.0+1.0j)
    >>> np.lib.scimath.sqrt([-1,4])
    array([ 0.+1.j,  2.+0.j])

    
    Take log base n of x.

    If `x` contains negative inputs, the answer is computed and returned in the
    complex domain.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : array_like
       The integer base(s) in which the log is taken.
    x : array_like
       The value(s) whose log base `n` is (are) required.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
       The log base `n` of the `x` value(s). If `x` was a scalar, so is
       `out`, otherwise an array is returned.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.set_printoptions(precision=4)

    >>> np.lib.scimath.logn(2, [4, 8])
    array([ 2.,  3.])
    >>> np.lib.scimath.logn(2, [-4, -8, 8])
    array([ 2.+4.5324j,  3.+4.5324j,  3.+0.j    ])

    _take_along_axis_dispatchertile.<locals>.<genexpr><module numpy.lib.shape_base>_column_stack_dispatcherin_dimsshape_ones
    Split array into multiple sub-arrays along the 3rd axis (depth).

    Please refer to the `split` documentation.  `dsplit` is equivalent
    to `split` with ``axis=2``, the array is always split along the third
    axis provided the array dimension is greater than or equal to 3.

    See Also
    --------
    split : Split an array into multiple sub-arrays of equal size.

    Examples

    >>> x
    array([[[  0.,   1.,   2.,   3.],
            [  4.,   5.,   6.,   7.]],

    get_array_preparearr_shapekronget_array_wrap
    Construct an array by repeating A the number of times given by reps.

    If `reps` has length ``d``, the result will have dimension of
    ``max(d, A.ndim)``.

    If ``A.ndim < d``, `A` is promoted to be d-dimensional by prepending new
    axes. So a shape (3,) array is promoted to (1, 3) for 2-D replication,
    or shape (1, 1, 3) for 3-D replication. If this is not the desired
    behavior, promote `A` to d-dimensions manually before calling this
    function.

    If ``A.ndim > d``, `reps` is promoted to `A`.ndim by pre-pending 1's to it.
    Thus for an `A` of shape (2, 3, 4, 5), a `reps` of (2, 2) is treated as
    (1, 1, 2, 2).

    Note : Although tile may be used for broadcasting, it is strongly
    recommended to use numpy's broadcasting operations and functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : array_like
        The input array.
    reps : array_like
        The number of repetitions of `A` along each axis.

    Returns
    -------
    c : ndarray
        The tiled output array.

    See Also
    --------
    repeat : Repeat elements of an array.
    broadcast_to : Broadcast an array to a new shape

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([0, 1, 2])
    >>> np.tile(a, 2)
    array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2])
    >>> np.tile(a, (2, 2))
    array([[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2],
           [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]])
    >>> np.tile(a, (2, 1, 2))
    array([[[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]],
           [[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]]])

    >>> b = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.tile(b, 2)
    array([[1, 2, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 3, 4]])

    Take values from the input array by matching 1d index and data slices.

    This iterates over matching 1d slices oriented along the specified axis in
    the index and data arrays, and uses the former to look up values in the
    latter. These slices can be different lengths.

    Functions returning an index along an axis, like `argsort` and
    `argpartition`, produce suitable indices for this function.

    .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr: ndarray (Ni..., M, Nk...)
        Source array
    indices: ndarray (Ni..., J, Nk...)
        Indices to take along each 1d slice of `arr`. This must match the
        dimension of arr, but dimensions Ni and Nj only need to broadcast
        against `arr`.
    axis: int
        The axis to take 1d slices along. If axis is None, the input array is
        treated as if it had first been flattened to 1d, for consistency with
        `sort` and `argsort`.

    Returns
    -------
    out: ndarray (Ni..., J, Nk...)
        The indexed result.

    Notes
    -----
    This is equivalent to (but faster than) the following use of `ndindex` and
    `s_`, which sets each of ``ii`` and ``kk`` to a tuple of indices::

        Ni, M, Nk = a.shape[:axis], a.shape[axis], a.shape[axis+1:]
        J = indices.shape[axis]  # Need not equal M
        out = np.empty(Nk + (J,) + Nk)

        for ii in ndindex(Ni):
            for kk in ndindex(Nk):
                a_1d       = a      [ii + s_[:,] + kk]
                indices_1d = indices[ii + s_[:,] + kk]
                out_1d     = out    [ii + s_[:,] + kk]
                for j in range(J):
                    out_1d[j] = a_1d[indices_1d[j]]

    Equivalently, eliminating the inner loop, the last two lines would be::

                out_1d[:] = a_1d[indices_1d]

    See Also
    --------
    take : Take along an axis, using the same indices for every 1d slice
    put_along_axis :
        Put values into the destination array by matching 1d index and data slices

    Examples
    --------

    For this sample array

    >>> a = np.array([[10, 30, 20], [60, 40, 50]])

    We can sort either by using sort directly, or argsort and this function

    >>> np.sort(a, axis=1)
    array([[10, 20, 30],
           [40, 50, 60]])
    >>> ai = np.argsort(a, axis=1); ai
    array([[0, 2, 1],
           [1, 2, 0]], dtype=int64)
    >>> np.take_along_axis(a, ai, axis=1)
    array([[10, 20, 30],
           [40, 50, 60]])

    The same works for max and min, if you expand the dimensions:

    >>> np.expand_dims(np.max(a, axis=1), axis=1)
    array([[30],
           [60]])
    >>> ai = np.expand_dims(np.argmax(a, axis=1), axis=1)
    >>> ai
    array([[1],
           [0], dtype=int64)
    >>> np.take_along_axis(a, ai, axis=1)
    array([[30],
           [60]])

    If we want to get the max and min at the same time, we can stack the
    indices first

    >>> ai_min = np.expand_dims(np.argmin(a, axis=1), axis=1)
    >>> ai_max = np.expand_dims(np.argmax(a, axis=1), axis=1)
    >>> ai = np.concatenate([ai_min, ai_max], axis=axis)
    >> ai
    array([[0, 1],
           [1, 0]], dtype=int64)
    >>> np.take_along_axis(a, ai, axis=1)
    array([[10, 30],
           [40, 60]])

    Split an array into multiple sub-arrays horizontally (column-wise).

    Please refer to the `split` documentation.  `hsplit` is equivalent
    to `split` with ``axis=1``, the array is always split along the second
    axis regardless of the array dimension.

    Examples

    NtotalNsectionsdiv_pointsNeach_sectionsection_sizes
    Kronecker product of two arrays.

    Computes the Kronecker product, a composite array made of blocks of the
    second array scaled by the first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : array_like

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray

    See Also
    --------
    outer : The outer product

    Notes
    -----
    The function assumes that the number of dimensions of `a` and `b`
    are the same, if necessary prepending the smallest with ones.
    If `a.shape = (r0,r1,..,rN)` and `b.shape = (s0,s1,...,sN)`,
    the Kronecker product has shape `(r0*s0, r1*s1, ..., rN*SN)`.
    The elements are products of elements from `a` and `b`, organized
    explicitly by::

        kron(a,b)[k0,k1,...,kN] = a[i0,i1,...,iN] * b[j0,j1,...,jN]

    where::

        kt = it * st + jt,  t = 0,...,N

    In the common 2-D case (N=1), the block structure can be visualized::

        [[ a[0,0]*b,   a[0,1]*b,  ... , a[0,-1]*b  ],
         [  ...                              ...   ],
         [ a[-1,0]*b,  a[-1,1]*b, ... , a[-1,-1]*b ]]


    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.kron([1,10,100], [5,6,7])
    array([  5,   6,   7,  50,  60,  70, 500, 600, 700])
    >>> np.kron([5,6,7], [1,10,100])
    array([  5,  50, 500,   6,  60, 600,   7,  70, 700])

    >>> np.kron(np.eye(2), np.ones((2,2)))
    array([[ 1.,  1.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 1.,  1.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0.,  1.,  1.],
           [ 0.,  0.,  1.,  1.]])

    >>> a = np.arange(100).reshape((2,5,2,5))
    >>> b = np.arange(24).reshape((2,3,4))
    >>> c = np.kron(a,b)
    >>> c.shape
    (2, 10, 6, 20)
    >>> I = (1,3,0,2)
    >>> J = (0,2,1)
    >>> J1 = (0,) + J             # extend to ndim=4
    >>> S1 = (1,) + b.shape
    >>> K = tuple(np.array(I) * np.array(S1) + np.array(J1))
    >>> c[K] == a[I]*b[J]
    True

    
    Stack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third axis).

    This is equivalent to concatenation along the third axis after 2-D arrays
    of shape `(M,N)` have been reshaped to `(M,N,1)` and 1-D arrays of shape
    `(N,)` have been reshaped to `(1,N,1)`. Rebuilds arrays divided by
    `dsplit`.

    This function makes most sense for arrays with up to 3 dimensions. For
    instance, for pixel-data with a height (first axis), width (second axis),
    and r/g/b channels (third axis). The functions `concatenate`, `stack` and
    `block` provide more general stacking and concatenation operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tup : sequence of arrays
        The arrays must have the same shape along all but the third axis.
        1-D or 2-D arrays must have the same shape.

    Returns
    -------
    stacked : ndarray
        The array formed by stacking the given arrays, will be at least 3-D.

    See Also
    --------
    stack : Join a sequence of arrays along a new axis.
    vstack : Stack along first axis.
    hstack : Stack along second axis.
    concatenate : Join a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.
    dsplit : Split array along third axis.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array((1,2,3))
    >>> b = np.array((2,3,4))
    >>> np.dstack((a,b))
    array([[[1, 2],
            [2, 3],
            [3, 4]]])

    >>> a = np.array([[1],[2],[3]])
    >>> b = np.array([[2],[3],[4]])
    >>> np.dstack((a,b))
    array([[[1, 2]],
           [[2, 3]],
           [[3, 4]]])

    Put values into the destination array by matching 1d index and data slices.

    This iterates over matching 1d slices oriented along the specified axis in
    the index and data arrays, and uses the former to place values into the
    latter. These slices can be different lengths.

    .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr: ndarray (Ni..., M, Nk...)
        Destination array.
    indices: ndarray (Ni..., J, Nk...)
        Indices to change along each 1d slice of `arr`. This must match the
        dimension of arr, but dimensions in Ni and Nj may be 1 to broadcast
        against `arr`.
    values: array_like (Ni..., J, Nk...)
        values to insert at those indices. Its shape and dimension are
        broadcast to match that of `indices`.
    axis: int
        The axis to take 1d slices along. If axis is None, the destination
        array is treated as if a flattened 1d view had been created of it.

    Notes
    -----
    This is equivalent to (but faster than) the following use of `ndindex` and
    `s_`, which sets each of ``ii`` and ``kk`` to a tuple of indices::

        Ni, M, Nk = a.shape[:axis], a.shape[axis], a.shape[axis+1:]
        J = indices.shape[axis]  # Need not equal M

        for ii in ndindex(Ni):
            for kk in ndindex(Nk):
                a_1d       = a      [ii + s_[:,] + kk]

                for j in range(J):
                    a_1d[indices_1d[j]] = values_1d[j]

                a_1d[indices_1d] = values_1d

    See Also
    --------
    take_along_axis :
        Take values from the input array by matching 1d index and data slices

    Examples
    --------

    For this sample array

    >>> a = np.array([[10, 30, 20], [60, 40, 50]])

    We can replace the maximum values with:

    >>> ai = np.expand_dims(np.argmax(a, axis=1), axis=1)
    >>> ai
    array([[1],
           [0]], dtype=int64)
    >>> np.put_along_axis(a, ai, 99, axis=1)
    >>> a
    array([[10, 99, 20],
           [99, 40, 50]])

    
    Apply a function repeatedly over multiple axes.

    `func` is called as `res = func(a, axis)`, where `axis` is the first
    element of `axes`.  The result `res` of the function call must have
    either the same dimensions as `a` or one less dimension.  If `res`
    has one less dimension than `a`, a dimension is inserted before
    `axis`.  The call to `func` is then repeated for each axis in `axes`,
    with `res` as the first argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : function
        This function must take two arguments, `func(a, axis)`.
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axes : array_like
        Axes over which `func` is applied; the elements must be integers.

    Returns
    -------
    apply_over_axis : ndarray
        The output array.  The number of dimensions is the same as `a`,
        but the shape can be different.  This depends on whether `func`
        changes the shape of its output with respect to its input.

    See Also
    --------
    apply_along_axis :
        Apply a function to 1-D slices of an array along the given axis.

    Notes
    ------
    This function is equivalent to tuple axis arguments to reorderable ufuncs
    with keepdims=True. Tuple axis arguments to ufuncs have been available since
    version 1.7.0.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(24).reshape(2,3,4)
    >>> a
    array([[[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
            [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
            [ 8,  9, 10, 11]],
           [[12, 13, 14, 15],
            [16, 17, 18, 19],
            [20, 21, 22, 23]]])

    Sum over axes 0 and 2. The result has same number of dimensions
    as the original array:

    >>> np.apply_over_axes(np.sum, a, [0,2])
    array([[[ 60],
            [ 92],
            [124]]])

    Tuple axis arguments to ufuncs are equivalent:

    >>> np.sum(a, axis=(0,2), keepdims=True)
    array([[[ 60],
            [ 92],
            [124]]])

    _kron_dispatcherwrappersshape_out
    Split an array into multiple sub-arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ary : ndarray
        Array to be divided into sub-arrays.
    indices_or_sections : int or 1-D array
        If `indices_or_sections` is an integer, N, the array will be divided
        into N equal arrays along `axis`.  If such a split is not possible,
        an error is raised.

        If `indices_or_sections` is a 1-D array of sorted integers, the entries
        indicate where along `axis` the array is split.  For example,
        ``[2, 3]`` would, for ``axis=0``, result in

          - ary[:2]
          - ary[2:3]
          - ary[3:]

        If an index exceeds the dimension of the array along `axis`,
        an empty sub-array is returned correspondingly.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which to split, default is 0.

    Returns
    -------
    sub-arrays : list of ndarrays
        A list of sub-arrays.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `indices_or_sections` is given as an integer, but
        a split does not result in equal division.

    See Also
    --------
    array_split : Split an array into multiple sub-arrays of equal or
                  near-equal size.  Does not raise an exception if
                  an equal division cannot be made.
    hsplit : Split array into multiple sub-arrays horizontally (column-wise).
    vsplit : Split array into multiple sub-arrays vertically (row wise).
    dsplit : Split array into multiple sub-arrays along the 3rd axis (depth).
    concatenate : Join a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.

    Find the wrapper for the array with the highest priority.

    In case of ties, leftmost wins. If no wrapper is found, return None
    _apply_over_axes_dispatcher
    Split an array into multiple sub-arrays vertically (row-wise).

    Please refer to the ``split`` documentation.  ``vsplit`` is equivalent
    to ``split`` with `axis=0` (default), the array is always split along the
    first axis regardless of the array dimension.

    Both axis > a.ndim and axis < -a.ndim - 1 are deprecated and will raise an AxisError in the future.apply_along_axis.<locals>.<genexpr>_expand_dims_dispatcher
    Expand the shape of an array.

    Insert a new axis that will appear at the `axis` position in the expanded
    array shape.

    .. note:: Previous to NumPy 1.13.0, neither ``axis < -a.ndim - 1`` nor
       ``axis > a.ndim`` raised errors or put the new axis where documented.
       Those axis values are now deprecated and will raise an AxisError in the
       future.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int
        Position in the expanded axes where the new axis is placed.

    Returns
    -------
    res : ndarray
        Output array. The number of dimensions is one greater than that of
        the input array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1,2])
    >>> x.shape
    (2,)

    The following is equivalent to ``x[np.newaxis,:]`` or ``x[np.newaxis]``:

    True

    `indices` and `arr` must have the same number of dimensionsind0get_array_prepare.<locals>.<genexpr>
    Stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array.

    Take a sequence of 1-D arrays and stack them as columns
    to make a single 2-D array. 2-D arrays are stacked as-is,
    just like with `hstack`.  1-D arrays are turned into 2-D columns
    first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tup : sequence of 1-D or 2-D arrays.
        Arrays to stack. All of them must have the same first dimension.

    Returns
    -------
    stacked : 2-D array
        The array formed by stacking the given arrays.

    stack, hstack, vstack, concatenate

    Examples
    --------

    >>> np.column_stack((a,b))
    array([[1, 2],
           [2, 3],
           [3, 4]])

    inarr_view
    Apply a function to 1-D slices along the given axis.

    Execute `func1d(a, *args)` where `func1d` operates on 1-D arrays and `a`
    is a 1-D slice of `arr` along `axis`.

    This is equivalent to (but faster than) the following use of `ndindex` and
    `s_`, which sets each of ``ii``, ``jj``, and ``kk`` to a tuple of indices::

        Ni, Nk = a.shape[:axis], a.shape[axis+1:]
        for ii in ndindex(Ni):
            for kk in ndindex(Nk):
                f = func1d(arr[ii + s_[:,] + kk])
                Nj = f.shape
                for jj in ndindex(Nj):
                    out[ii + jj + kk] = f[jj]

    Equivalently, eliminating the inner loop, this can be expressed as::

        Ni, Nk = a.shape[:axis], a.shape[axis+1:]
        for ii in ndindex(Ni):
            for kk in ndindex(Nk):
                out[ii + s_[...,] + kk] = func1d(arr[ii + s_[:,] + kk])

    Parameters
    ----------
    func1d : function (M,) -> (Nj...)
        This function should accept 1-D arrays. It is applied to 1-D
        slices of `arr` along the specified axis.
    axis : integer
        Axis along which `arr` is sliced.
    arr : ndarray (Ni..., M, Nk...)
        Input array.
    args : any
        Additional arguments to `func1d`.
    kwargs : any
        Additional named arguments to `func1d`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0


    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray  (Ni..., Nj..., Nk...)
        The output array. The shape of `out` is identical to the shape of
        `arr`, except along the `axis` dimension. This axis is removed, and
        replaced with new dimensions equal to the shape of the return value
        of `func1d`. So if `func1d` returns a scalar `out` will have one
        fewer dimensions than `arr`.

    See Also
    --------
    apply_over_axes : Apply a function repeatedly over multiple axes.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> def my_func(a):
    ...     """Average first and last element of a 1-D array"""
    ...     return (a[0] + a[-1]) * 0.5
    >>> b = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]])
    >>> np.apply_along_axis(my_func, 0, b)
    array([ 4.,  5.,  6.])
    >>> np.apply_along_axis(my_func, 1, b)
    array([ 2.,  5.,  8.])

    For a function that returns a 1D array, the number of dimensions in
    `outarr` is the same as `arr`.

    >>> b = np.array([[8,1,7], [4,3,9], [5,2,6]])
    >>> np.apply_along_axis(sorted, 1, b)
    array([[1, 7, 8],
           [3, 4, 9],
           [2, 5, 6]])

    For a function that returns a higher dimensional array, those dimensions
    are inserted in place of the `axis` dimension.

    >>> b = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]])
    >>> np.apply_along_axis(np.diag, -1, b)
    array([[[1, 0, 0],
            [0, 2, 0],
            [0, 0, 3]],
           [[4, 0, 0],
            [0, 5, 0],
            [0, 0, 6]],
           [[7, 0, 0],

            [0, 0, 9]]])
    hsplit only works on arrays of 1 or more dimensions`indices` must be an integer arrayarray split does not result in an equal division
    Split an array into multiple sub-arrays.

    Please refer to the ``split`` documentation.  The only difference
    between these functions is that ``array_split`` allows
    `indices_or_sections` to be an integer that does *not* equally
    divide the axis. For an array of length l that should be split
    into n sections, it returns l % n sub-arrays of size l//n + 1
    and the rest of size l//n.

    _maybe_view_as_subclass
    Broadcast any number of arrays against each other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `*args` : array_likes
        The arrays to broadcast.

    subok : bool, optional
        If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise
        the returned arrays will be forced to be a base-class array (default).

    Returns
    -------
    broadcasted : list of arrays
        These arrays are views on the original arrays.  They are typically
        not contiguous.  Furthermore, more than one element of a
        broadcasted array may refer to a single memory location.  If you
        need to write to the arrays, make copies first.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[1,2,3]])
    >>> y = np.array([[4],[5]])
    >>> np.broadcast_arrays(x, y)
    [array([[1, 2, 3],
           [1, 2, 3]]), array([[4, 4, 4],
           [5, 5, 5]])]

    Here is a useful idiom for getting contiguous copies instead of
    non-contiguous views.

    >>> [np.array(a) for a in np.broadcast_arrays(x, y)]
    [array([[1, 2, 3],
           [1, 2, 3]]), array([[4, 4, 4],

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : array_like
        The array to broadcast.
    shape : tuple
        The shape of the desired array.
    subok : bool, optional
        If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise
        the returned array will be forced to be a base-class array (default).

    Returns
    -------
    broadcast : array
        A readonly view on the original array with the given shape. It is
        typically not contiguous. Furthermore, more than one element of a
        broadcasted array may refer to a single memory location.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the array is not compatible with the new shape according to NumPy's
        broadcasting rules.

Utilities that manipulate strides to achieve desirable effects.

An explanation of strides can be found in the "ndarray.rst" file in the
NumPy reference guide.

needs_writeableReturns the shape of the arrays that would result from broadcasting the
    supplied arrays against each other.
    cannot broadcast a non-scalar to a scalar array
    Create a view into the array with the given shape and strides.

    .. warning:: This function has to be used with extreme care, see notes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray
        Array to create a new.
    shape : sequence of int, optional
        The shape of the new array. Defaults to ``x.shape``.
    strides : sequence of int, optional
        The strides of the new array. Defaults to ``x.strides``.
    subok : bool, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10

        If True, subclasses are preserved.
    writeable : bool, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.12

        If set to False, the returned array will always be readonly.
        Otherwise it will be writable if the original array was. It
        is advisable to set this to False if possible (see Notes).

    Returns
    -------
    view : ndarray

    See also
    --------
    broadcast_to: broadcast an array to a given shape.
    reshape : reshape an array.

    Notes
    -----
    ``as_strided`` creates a view into the array given the exact strides
    and shape. This means it manipulates the internal data structure of
    ndarray and, if done incorrectly, the array elements can point to
    invalid memory and can corrupt results or crash your program.
    It is advisable to always use the original ``x.strides`` when
    calculating new strides to avoid reliance on a contiguous memory
    layout.

    Furthermore, arrays created with this function often contain self
    overlapping memory, so that two elements are identical.
    Vectorized write operations on such arrays will typically be
    unpredictable. They may even give different results for small, large,
    or transposed arrays.
    Since writing to these arrays has to be tested and done with great
    care, you may want to use ``writeable=False`` to avoid accidental write
    operations.

    For these reasons it is advisable to avoid ``as_strided`` when
    possible.

    <module numpy.lib.twodim_base>
    Generate a Vandermonde matrix.

    The columns of the output matrix are powers of the input vector. The
    order of the powers is determined by the `increasing` boolean argument.
    Specifically, when `increasing` is False, the `i`-th output column is
    the input vector raised element-wise to the power of ``N - i - 1``. Such
    a matrix with a geometric progression in each row is named for Alexandre-
    Theophile Vandermonde.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        1-D input array.
    N : int, optional
        Number of columns in the output.  If `N` is not specified, a square
        array is returned (``N = len(x)``).
    increasing : bool, optional
        Order of the powers of the columns.  If True, the powers increase
        from left to right, if False (the default) they are reversed.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Vandermonde matrix.  If `increasing` is False, the first column is
        ``x^(N-1)``, the second ``x^(N-2)`` and so forth. If `increasing` is
        True, the columns are ``x^0, x^1, ..., x^(N-1)``.

           [  1,   5,  25, 125]])

    The determinant of a square Vandermonde matrix is the product
    of the differences between the values of the input vector:

    Input must be 1- or 2-d.Input must be >= 2-d._histogram2d_dispatcheryedgesmask_func
    Compute the bi-dimensional histogram of two data samples.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (N,)
        An array containing the x coordinates of the points to be
        histogrammed.
    y : array_like, shape (N,)
        An array containing the y coordinates of the points to be
        histogrammed.
    bins : int or array_like or [int, int] or [array, array], optional
        The bin specification:

          * If int, the number of bins for the two dimensions (nx=ny=bins).
          * If array_like, the bin edges for the two dimensions
            (x_edges=y_edges=bins).
          * If [int, int], the number of bins in each dimension
            (nx, ny = bins).
          * If [array, array], the bin edges in each dimension
            (x_edges, y_edges = bins).
          * A combination [int, array] or [array, int], where int
            is the number of bins and array is the bin edges.

    range : array_like, shape(2,2), optional
        The leftmost and rightmost edges of the bins along each dimension
        (if not specified explicitly in the `bins` parameters):
        ``[[xmin, xmax], [ymin, ymax]]``. All values outside of this range
        will be considered outliers and not tallied in the histogram.
    density : bool, optional
        If False, the default, returns the number of samples in each bin.
        If True, returns the probability *density* function at the bin,
        ``bin_count / sample_count / bin_area``.
    normed : bool, optional
        An alias for the density argument that behaves identically. To avoid
        confusion with the broken normed argument to `histogram`, `density`
        should be preferred.
    weights : array_like, shape(N,), optional
        An array of values ``w_i`` weighing each sample ``(x_i, y_i)``.
        Weights are normalized to 1 if `normed` is True. If `normed` is
        False, the values of the returned histogram are equal to the sum of
        the weights belonging to the samples falling into each bin.

    Returns
    -------
    H : ndarray, shape(nx, ny)
        The bi-dimensional histogram of samples `x` and `y`. Values in `x`
        are histogrammed along the first dimension and values in `y` are
        histogrammed along the second dimension.
    xedges : ndarray, shape(nx+1,)
        The bin edges along the first dimension.
    yedges : ndarray, shape(ny+1,)
        The bin edges along the second dimension.

    See Also
    --------
    histogram : 1D histogram
    histogramdd : Multidimensional histogram

    Notes
    -----
    When `normed` is True, then the returned histogram is the sample
    density, defined such that the sum over bins of the product
    ``bin_value * bin_area`` is 1.

    Please note that the histogram does not follow the Cartesian convention
    where `x` values are on the abscissa and `y` values on the ordinate
    axis.  Rather, `x` is histogrammed along the first dimension of the
    array (vertical), and `y` along the second dimension of the array
    (horizontal).  This ensures compatibility with `histogramdd`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from matplotlib.image import NonUniformImage
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    Construct a 2-D histogram with variable bin width. First define the bin
    edges:

    >>> xedges = [0, 1, 3, 5]
    >>> yedges = [0, 2, 3, 4, 6]

    Next we create a histogram H with random bin content:

    >>> x = np.random.normal(2, 1, 100)
    >>> y = np.random.normal(1, 1, 100)
    >>> H, xedges, yedges = np.histogram2d(x, y, bins=(xedges, yedges))
    >>> H = H.T  # Let each row list bins with common y range.

    :func:`imshow <matplotlib.pyplot.imshow>` can only display square bins:

    >>> fig = plt.figure(figsize=(7, 3))

    >>> plt.imshow(H, interpolation='nearest', origin='low',
    ...         extent=[xedges[0], xedges[-1], yedges[0], yedges[-1]])

    :func:`pcolormesh <matplotlib.pyplot.pcolormesh>` can display actual edges:

    >>> ax = fig.add_subplot(132, title='pcolormesh: actual edges',
    ...         aspect='equal')
    >>> X, Y = np.meshgrid(xedges, yedges)
    >>> ax.pcolormesh(X, Y, H)

    :class:`NonUniformImage <matplotlib.image.NonUniformImage>` can be used to
    display actual bin edges with interpolation:

    >>> ax = fig.add_subplot(133, title='NonUniformImage: interpolated',
    ...         aspect='equal', xlim=xedges[[0, -1]], ylim=yedges[[0, -1]])
    >>> im = NonUniformImage(ax, interpolation='bilinear')
    >>> xcenters = (xedges[:-1] + xedges[1:]) / 2
    >>> ycenters = (yedges[:-1] + yedges[1:]) / 2
    >>> im.set_data(xcenters, ycenters, H)
    >>> ax.images.append(im)
    >>> plt.show()

    Return the indices for the upper-triangle of an (n, m) array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The size of the arrays for which the returned indices will
        be valid.
    k : int, optional
        Diagonal offset (see `triu` for details).

    .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

    Examples
    --------
    Compute two different sets of indices to access 4x4 arrays, one for the
    upper triangular part starting at the main diagonal, and one starting two
    diagonals further right:

    >>> iu1 = np.triu_indices(4)
    >>> iu2 = np.triu_indices(4, 2)

    Here is how they can be used with a sample array:

    >>> a = np.arange(16).reshape(4, 4)
    >>> a
    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
           [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
           [ 8,  9, 10, 11],
           [12, 13, 14, 15]])

    Both for indexing:

    >>> a[iu1]
    array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  5,  6,  7, 10, 11, 15])

    And for assigning values:

    >>> a[iu1] = -1
    >>> a
    array([[-1, -1, -1, -1],
           [ 4, -1, -1, -1],
           [ 8,  9, -1, -1],
           [12, 13, 14, -1]])

    These cover only a small part of the whole array (two diagonals right
    of the main one):

    >>> a[iu2] = -10
    >>> a
    array([[ -1,  -1, -10, -10],
           [  4,  -1,  -1, -10],
           [  8,   9,  -1,  -1],

      Data-type of the returned array.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
        Whether the output should be stored in row-major (C-style) or

    _min_int
    Extract a diagonal or construct a diagonal array.

    See the more detailed documentation for ``numpy.diagonal`` if you use this
    function to extract a diagonal and wish to write to the resulting array;
    whether it returns a copy or a view depends on what version of numpy you
    are using.

    Parameters
    ----------
    v : array_like
        If `v` is a 2-D array, return a copy of its `k`-th diagonal.
        If `v` is a 1-D array, return a 2-D array with `v` on the `k`-th
        diagonal.
    k : int, optional
        Diagonal in question. The default is 0. Use `k>0` for diagonals
        above the main diagonal, and `k<0` for diagonals below the main
        diagonal.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The extracted diagonal or constructed diagonal array.

    See Also
    --------
    diagonal : Return specified diagonals.
    diagflat : Create a 2-D array with the flattened input as a diagonal.
    trace : Sum along diagonals.
    triu : Upper triangle of an array.
    tril : Lower triangle of an array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(9).reshape((3,3))
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5],
           [6, 7, 8]])

    >>> np.diag(x)
    array([0, 4, 8])
    >>> np.diag(x, k=1)
    array([1, 5])
    >>> np.diag(x, k=-1)
    array([3, 7])

    >>> np.diag(np.diag(x))
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [0, 0, 8]])

    
    Return the indices to access (n, n) arrays, given a masking function.

    Assume `mask_func` is a function that, for a square array a of size
    ``(n, n)`` with a possible offset argument `k`, when called as
    ``mask_func(a, k)`` returns a new array with zeros in certain locations
    (functions like `triu` or `tril` do precisely this). Then this function
    returns the indices where the non-zero values would be located.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The returned indices will be valid to access arrays of shape (n, n).
    mask_func : callable
        A function whose call signature is similar to that of `triu`, `tril`.
        That is, ``mask_func(x, k)`` returns a boolean array, shaped like `x`.
        `k` is an optional argument to the function.
    k : scalar
        An optional argument which is passed through to `mask_func`. Functions
        like `triu`, `tril` take a second argument that is interpreted as an
        offset.

    Returns
    -------
    indices : tuple of arrays.
        The `n` arrays of indices corresponding to the locations where
        ``mask_func(np.ones((n, n)), k)`` is True.

    triu, tril, triu_indices, tril_indices

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

    Examples
    --------
    These are the indices that would allow you to access the upper triangular
    part of any 3x3 array:

    >>> iu = np.mask_indices(3, np.triu)

    For example, if `a` is a 3x3 array:

    >>> a = np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3)
    >>> a
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5],
           [6, 7, 8]])
    >>> a[iu]
    array([0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8])

    An offset can be passed also to the masking function.  This gets us the
    indices starting on the first diagonal right of the main one:

    >>> iu1 = np.mask_indices(3, np.triu, 1)

    with which we now extract only three elements:

    >>> a[iu1]
    array([1, 2, 5])

    input array must be 2-d
    Upper triangle of an array.

    Return a copy of a matrix with the elements below the `k`-th diagonal
    zeroed.

    --------
    tril : lower triangle of an array

    Examples
    --------

    array([[ 1,  2,  3],
           [ 4,  5,  6],
           [ 0,  8,  9],
           [ 0,  0, 12]])

    Input must be >= 1-d.
    Return the indices for the lower-triangle of an (n, m) array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The row dimension of the arrays for which the returned
        indices will be valid.
    k : int, optional
        Diagonal offset (see `tril` for details).
    m : int, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

        The column dimension of the arrays for which the returned
        arrays will be valid.
        By default `m` is taken equal to `n`.


    Returns
    -------
    inds : tuple of arrays
        The indices for the triangle. The returned tuple contains two arrays,
        each with the indices along one dimension of the array.

    .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

    Examples
    --------
    Compute two different sets of indices to access 4x4 arrays, one for the
    lower triangular part starting at the main diagonal, and one starting two
    diagonals further right:

    >>> il1 = np.tril_indices(4)
    >>> il2 = np.tril_indices(4, 2)

    Here is how they can be used with a sample array:

    >>> a = np.arange(16).reshape(4, 4)
    >>> a
    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
           [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
           [ 8,  9, 10, 11],
           [12, 13, 14, 15]])

    Both for indexing:

    >>> a[il1]
    array([ 0,  4,  5,  8,  9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15])

    And for assigning values:

    >>> a[il1] = -1
    >>> a
    array([[-1,  1,  2,  3],
           [-1, -1,  6,  7],
           [-1, -1, -1, 11],
           [-1, -1, -1, -1]])

    These cover almost the whole array (two diagonals right of the main one):

    >>> a[il2] = -10
    >>> a
    array([[-10, -10, -10,   3],
           [-10, -10, -10, -10],
           [-10, -10, -10, -10],
           [-10, -10, -10, -10]])

    asscalar
    Return the character for the minimum-size type to which given types can
    be safely cast.

    The returned type character must represent the smallest size dtype such
    that an array of the returned type can handle the data from an array of
    all types in `typechars` (or if `typechars` is an array, then its
    dtype.char).

    Parameters
    ----------
    typechars : list of str or array_like
        If a list of strings, each string should represent a dtype.
        If array_like, the character representation of the array dtype is used.
    typeset : str or list of str, optional
        The set of characters that the returned character is chosen from.
        The default set is 'GDFgdf'.
    default : str, optional
        The default character, this is returned if none of the characters in
        `typechars` matches a character in `typeset`.

    Returns
    -------
    typechar : str
        The character representing the minimum-size type that was found.

    Return the imaginary part of the complex argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    val : array_like
        Input array.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
        The imaginary component of the complex argument. If `val` is real,
        the type of `val` is used for the output.  If `val` has complex
        elements, the returned type is float.

    _imag_dispatcher_nan_to_num_dispatcher
    Check for a complex type or an array of complex numbers.

    The type of the input is checked, not the value. Even if the input
    has an imaginary part equal to zero, `iscomplexobj` evaluates to True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : any
        The input can be of any type and shape.

    Returns
    -------
    iscomplexobj : bool
        The return value, True if `x` is of a complex type or has at least
        one complex element.

    See Also
    --------
    isrealobj, iscomplex

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.iscomplexobj(1)
    False
    >>> np.iscomplexobj(1+0j)
    True
    >>> np.iscomplexobj([3, 1+0j, True])
    True

    _real_dispatcherxtype
    Replace NaN with zero and infinity with large finite numbers.

    If `x` is inexact, NaN is replaced by zero, and infinity and -infinity
    replaced by the respectively largest and most negative finite floating
    point values representable by ``x.dtype``.

    For complex dtypes, the above is applied to each of the real and
    imaginary components of `x` separately.

    If `x` is not inexact, then no replacements are made.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : scalar or array_like
        Input data.
    copy : bool, optional
        Whether to create a copy of `x` (True) or to replace values
        in-place (False). The in-place operation only occurs if
        casting to an array does not require a copy.
        Default is True.

        .. versionadded:: 1.13

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        `x`, with the non-finite values replaced. If `copy` is False, this may
        be `x` itself.

    See Also
    --------
    isinf : Shows which elements are positive or negative infinity.
    isneginf : Shows which elements are negative infinity.
    isposinf : Shows which elements are positive infinity.
    isnan : Shows which elements are Not a Number (NaN).
    isfinite : Shows which elements are finite (not NaN, not infinity)

    Notes
    -----
    NumPy uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic
    (IEEE 754). This means that Not a Number is not equivalent to infinity.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.nan_to_num(np.inf)

    >>> np.nan_to_num(-np.inf)
    -1.7976931348623157e+308
    >>> np.nan_to_num(np.nan)
    0.0
    >>> x = np.array([np.inf, -np.inf, np.nan, -128, 128])
    >>> np.nan_to_num(x)
    array([  1.79769313e+308,  -1.79769313e+308,   0.00000000e+000,
            -1.28000000e+002,   1.28000000e+002])

             0.00000000e+000 +1.79769313e+308j])
    
    Return True if x is a not complex type or an array of complex numbers.

    The type of the input is checked, not the value. So even if the input
    has an imaginary part equal to zero, `isrealobj` evaluates to False
    if the data type is complex.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : any
        The input can be of any type and shape.

    Returns
    -------
    y : bool
        The return value, False if `x` is of a complex type.

    Return a scalar type which is common to the input arrays.

    The return type will always be an inexact (i.e. floating point) scalar
    type, even if all the arrays are integer arrays. If one of the inputs is
    an integer array, the minimum precision type that is returned is a
    64-bit floating point dtype.

    All input arrays except int64 and uint64 can be safely cast to the
    returned dtype without loss of information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array1, array2, ... : ndarrays
        Input arrays.

    Returns
    -------
    out : data type code
        Data type code.

        'int' dtypes, it is replaced with float64.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The input `a` as a float ndarray.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.asfarray([2, 3])

    maxf_real_if_close_dispatcher_is_type_dispatcher
    Returns a bool array, where True if input element is complex.

    What is tested is whether the input has a non-zero imaginary part, not if
    the input type is complex.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array.

    Returns

    iscomplexobj : Return True if x is a complex type or an array of complex
                   numbers.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.iscomplex([1+1j, 1+0j, 4.5, 3, 2, 2j])
    array([ True, False, False, False, False,  True])

    
    If complex input returns a real array if complex parts are close to zero.

    "Close to zero" is defined as `tol` * (machine epsilon of the type for
    `a`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    tol : float
        Tolerance in machine epsilons for the complex part of the elements
        in the array.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        If `a` is real, the type of `a` is used for the output.  If `a`
        has complex elements, the returned type is float.

    See Also
    --------
    real, imag, angle

    Notes
    -----
    Machine epsilon varies from machine to machine and between data types
    but Python floats on most platforms have a machine epsilon equal to
    2.2204460492503131e-16.  You can use 'np.finfo(float).eps' to print
    out the machine epsilon for floats.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.finfo(float).eps
    2.2204460492503131e-16

    >>> np.real_if_close([2.1 + 4e-14j], tol=1000)

    Get help information for a function, class, or module.

    Parameters
    ----------
    object : object or str, optional
        Input object or name to get information about. If `object` is a
        numpy object, its docstring is given. If it is a string, available
        modules are searched for matching objects.  If None, information
        about `info` itself is returned.
    maxwidth : int, optional
        Printing width.
    output : file like object, optional
        File like object that the output is written to, default is
        ``stdout``.  The object has to be opened in 'w' or 'a' mode.
    toplevel : str, optional
        Start search at this level.

    See Also
    --------
    source, lookfor

    Notes
    -----
    When used interactively with an object, ``np.info(obj)`` is equivalent
    to ``help(obj)`` on the Python prompt or ``obj?`` on the IPython
    prompt.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.info(np.polyval) # doctest: +SKIP
       polyval(p, x)
         Evaluate the polynomial p at x.
         ...

    When using a string for `object` it is possible to get multiple results.

    Print or write to a file the source code for a NumPy object.

    The source code is only returned for objects written in Python. Many
    functions and classes are defined in C and will therefore not return
    useful information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    object : numpy object
        Input object. This can be any object (function, class, module,
        ...).
    output : file object, optional
        If `output` not supplied then source code is printed to screen
        (sys.stdout).  File object must be created with either write 'w' or
        append 'a' modes.

    The source code is only returned for objects written in Python.

    >>> np.source(np.array)                         #doctest: +SKIP
    Not available for this object.

    
    Returns pointers to the end-points of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input array. It must conform to the Python-side of the array
        interface.

    Returns
    -------
    (low, high) : tuple of 2 integers
        The first integer is the first byte of the array, the second
        integer is just past the last byte of the array.  If `a` is not
        contiguous it will not use every byte between the (`low`, `high`)
        values.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> I = np.eye(2, dtype='f'); I.dtype
    dtype('float32')
    >>> low, high = np.byte_bounds(I)
    >>> high - low == I.size*I.itemsize
    True
    >>> I = np.eye(2, dtype='G'); I.dtype
    dtype('complex192')
    >>> low, high = np.byte_bounds(I)
    >>> high - low == I.size*I.itemsize
    True

numpy.linalg.info<module numpy.linalg.info>Cast the type t to either double or cdouble._raise_linalgerror_eigenvalues_nonconvergence
    Find the best order for three arrays and do the multiplication.

    Matrix or vector norm.

    This function is able to return one of eight different matrix norms,
    or one of an infinite number of vector norms (described below), depending
    on the value of the ``ord`` parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array.  If `axis` is None, `x` must be 1-D or 2-D.
    ord : {non-zero int, inf, -inf, 'fro', 'nuc'}, optional
        Order of the norm (see table under ``Notes``). inf means numpy's
        `inf` object.
    axis : {int, 2-tuple of ints, None}, optional
        If `axis` is an integer, it specifies the axis of `x` along which to
        compute the vector norms.  If `axis` is a 2-tuple, it specifies the
        axes that hold 2-D matrices, and the matrix norms of these matrices
        are computed.  If `axis` is None then either a vector norm (when `x`
        is 1-D) or a matrix norm (when `x` is 2-D) is returned.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are normed over are left in the
        result as dimensions with size one.  With this option the result will
        broadcast correctly against the original `x`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    Returns
    -------
    n : float or ndarray
        Norm of the matrix or vector(s).

    Notes
    -----
    For values of ``ord <= 0``, the result is, strictly speaking, not a
    mathematical 'norm', but it may still be useful for various numerical
    purposes.

    The following norms can be calculated:

    =====  ============================  ==========================
    ord    norm for matrices             norm for vectors
    =====  ============================  ==========================
    None   Frobenius norm                2-norm
    'fro'  Frobenius norm                --
    'nuc'  nuclear norm                  --
    inf    max(sum(abs(x), axis=1))      max(abs(x))
    -inf   min(sum(abs(x), axis=1))      min(abs(x))
    0      --                            sum(x != 0)
    1      max(sum(abs(x), axis=0))      as below
    -1     min(sum(abs(x), axis=0))      as below
    2      2-norm (largest sing. value)  as below
    -2     smallest singular value       as below
    other  --                            sum(abs(x)**ord)**(1./ord)
    =====  ============================  ==========================

    The Frobenius norm is given by [1]_:

        :math:`||A||_F = [\sum_{i,j} abs(a_{i,j})^2]^{1/2}`

    The nuclear norm is the sum of the singular values.

    eigh_losvd_mreturn_costsa1b0array type %s is unsupported in linalg
    Compute the eigenvalues of a complex Hermitian or real symmetric matrix.

    Main difference from eigh: the eigenvectors are not computed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, M) array_like
        A complex- or real-valued matrix whose eigenvalues are to be
        computed.
    UPLO : {'L', 'U'}, optional
        Specifies whether the calculation is done with the lower triangular
        part of `a` ('L', default) or the upper triangular part ('U').
        Irrespective of this value only the real parts of the diagonal will
        be considered in the computation to preserve the notion of a Hermitian
        matrix. It therefore follows that the imaginary part of the diagonal
        will always be treated as zero.

    Returns
    -------
    w : (..., M,) ndarray
        The eigenvalues in ascending order, each repeated according to
        its multiplicity.

    Raises
    ------
    LinAlgError
        If the eigenvalue computation does not converge.

    --------
    eigh : eigenvalues and eigenvectors of real symmetric or complex Hermitian

    svd_m_fcost2_linalg_error_extobjMatrix is not positive definitecompute_uvActually do the multiplication with the given order.routine_nameeconomic
    Compute the sign and (natural) logarithm of the determinant of an array.

    If an array has a very small or very large determinant, then a call to
    `det` may overflow or underflow. This routine is more robust against such
    issues, because it computes the logarithm of the determinant rather than
    the determinant itself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, M) array_like
        Input array, has to be a square 2-D array.

    Returns
    -------
    sign : (...) array_like
        A number representing the sign of the determinant. For a real matrix,
        this is 1, 0, or -1. For a complex matrix, this is a complex number
        with absolute value 1 (i.e., it is on the unit circle), or else 0.
    logdet : (...) array_like
        The natural log of the absolute value of the determinant.

    If the determinant is zero, then `sign` will be 0 and `logdet` will be
    -Inf. In all cases, the determinant is equal to ``sign * np.exp(logdet)``.

    .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    The determinant is computed via LU factorization using the LAPACK
    routine z/dgetrf.


    Examples
    --------
    The determinant of a 2-D array ``[[a, b], [c, d]]`` is ``ad - bc``:

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> (sign, logdet) = np.linalg.slogdet(a)
    >>> (sign, logdet)
    (-1, 0.69314718055994529)
    >>> sign * np.exp(logdet)
    -2.0

    Computing log-determinants for a stack of matrices:

    >>> a = np.array([ [[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [2, 1]], [[1, 3], [3, 1]] ])
    >>> a.shape
    (3, 2, 2)
    >>> sign, logdet = np.linalg.slogdet(a)
    >>> (sign, logdet)
    (array([-1., -1., -1.]), array([ 0.69314718,  1.09861229,  2.07944154]))
    >>> sign * np.exp(logdet)
    array([-2., -3., -8.])

    This routine succeeds where ordinary `det` does not:

    >>> np.linalg.det(np.eye(500) * 0.1)
    0.0
    >>> np.linalg.slogdet(np.eye(500) * 0.1)
    (1, -1151.2925464970228)

    invalid_call_errmask_raise_linalgerror_nonposdefndim_lastnumpy.linalg.linalg
    Compute the qr factorization of a matrix.

    Factor the matrix `a` as *qr*, where `q` is orthonormal and `r` is
    upper-triangular.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like, shape (M, N)
        Matrix to be factored.
    mode : {'reduced', 'complete', 'r', 'raw', 'full', 'economic'}, optional
        If K = min(M, N), then

        * 'reduced'  : returns q, r with dimensions (M, K), (K, N) (default)
        * 'complete' : returns q, r with dimensions (M, M), (M, N)
        * 'r'        : returns r only with dimensions (K, N)
        * 'raw'      : returns h, tau with dimensions (N, M), (K,)
        * 'full'     : alias of 'reduced', deprecated
        * 'economic' : returns h from 'raw', deprecated.

        The options 'reduced', 'complete, and 'raw' are new in numpy 1.8,
        see the notes for more information. The default is 'reduced', and to
        maintain backward compatibility with earlier versions of numpy both
        it and the old default 'full' can be omitted. Note that array h
        returned in 'raw' mode is transposed for calling Fortran. The
        'economic' mode is deprecated.  The modes 'full' and 'economic' may
        be passed using only the first letter for backwards compatibility,
        but all others must be spelled out. See the Notes for more
        explanation.


    Returns
    -------
    q : ndarray of float or complex, optional
        A matrix with orthonormal columns. When mode = 'complete' the
        result is an orthogonal/unitary matrix depending on whether or not
        a is real/complex. The determinant may be either +/- 1 in that
        case.
    r : ndarray of float or complex, optional
        The upper-triangular matrix.
    (h, tau) : ndarrays of np.double or np.cdouble, optional
        The array h contains the Householder reflectors that generate q
        along with r. The tau array contains scaling factors for the
        reflectors. In the deprecated  'economic' mode only h is returned.

    Raises
    ------
    LinAlgError
        If factoring fails.

    This is an interface to the LAPACK routines dgeqrf, zgeqrf,
    dorgqr, and zungqr.

    For more information on the qr factorization, see for example:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_factorization

    Subclasses of `ndarray` are preserved except for the 'raw' mode. So if
    `a` is of type `matrix`, all the return values will be matrices too.

    New 'reduced', 'complete', and 'raw' options for mode were added in
    NumPy 1.8.0 and the old option 'full' was made an alias of 'reduced'.  In
    addition the options 'full' and 'economic' were deprecated.  Because
    'full' was the previous default and 'reduced' is the new default,
    backward compatibility can be maintained by letting `mode` default.
    The 'raw' option was added so that LAPACK routines that can multiply
    arrays by q using the Householder reflectors can be used. Note that in
    this case the returned arrays are of type np.double or np.cdouble and
    the h array is transposed to be FORTRAN compatible.  No routines using
    the 'raw' return are currently exposed by numpy, but some are available
    in lapack_lite and just await the necessary work.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.random.randn(9, 6)
    >>> q, r = np.linalg.qr(a)
    >>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(q, r))  # a does equal qr
    True
    >>> r2 = np.linalg.qr(a, mode='r')
    >>> r3 = np.linalg.qr(a, mode='economic')
    >>> np.allclose(r, r2)  # mode='r' returns the same r as mode='full'
    True
    >>> # But only triu parts are guaranteed equal when mode='economic'
    >>> np.allclose(r, np.triu(r3[:6,:6], k=0))
    True

    Example illustrating a common use of `qr`: solving of least squares
    problems

    What are the least-squares-best `m` and `y0` in ``y = y0 + mx`` for
    the following data: {(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)}. (Graph the points
    and you'll see that it should be y0 = 0, m = 1.)  The answer is provided
    by solving the over-determined matrix equation ``Ax = b``, where::

      A = array([[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]])
      x = array([[y0], [m]])
      b = array([[1], [0], [2], [1]])

    If A = qr such that q is orthonormal (which is always possible via
    Gram-Schmidt), then ``x = inv(r) * (q.T) * b``.  (In numpy practice,
    however, we simply use `lstsq`.)

    >>> A = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]])
    >>> A
    array([[0, 1],
           [1, 1],
           [1, 1],
           [2, 1]])
    >>> b = np.array([1, 0, 2, 1])
    >>> q, r = LA.qr(A)
    >>> p = np.dot(q.T, b)
    >>> np.dot(LA.inv(r), p)
    array([  1.1e-16,   1.0e+00])

    row_axiscol_axiscost1real_t
    Return the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a complex Hermitian
    (conjugate symmetric) or a real symmetric matrix.

    Returns two objects, a 1-D array containing the eigenvalues of `a`, and
    a 2-D square array or matrix (depending on the input type) of the
    corresponding eigenvectors (in columns).

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, M) array
        Hermitian or real symmetric matrices whose eigenvalues and
        eigenvectors are to be computed.
    UPLO : {'L', 'U'}, optional
        Specifies whether the calculation is done with the lower triangular
        part of `a` ('L', default) or the upper triangular part ('U').
        Irrespective of this value only the real parts of the diagonal will
        be considered in the computation to preserve the notion of a Hermitian
        matrix. It therefore follows that the imaginary part of the diagonal
        will always be treated as zero.

    Returns
    -------
    w : (..., M) ndarray
        The eigenvalues in ascending order, each repeated according to
        its multiplicity.
    v : {(..., M, M) ndarray, (..., M, M) matrix}
        The column ``v[:, i]`` is the normalized eigenvector corresponding
        to the eigenvalue ``w[i]``.  Will return a matrix object if `a` is
        a matrix object.

    Raises
    ------
    LinAlgError
        If the eigenvalue computation does not converge.

    The eigenvalues of real symmetric or complex Hermitian matrices are
    always real. [1]_ The array `v` of (column) eigenvectors is unitary
    and `a`, `w`, and `v` satisfy the equations
    ``dot(a, v[:, i]) = w[i] * v[:, i]``.

    Return the least-squares solution to a linear matrix equation.

    Solves the equation `a x = b` by computing a vector `x` that
    minimizes the Euclidean 2-norm `|| b - a x ||^2`.  The equation may
    be under-, well-, or over- determined (i.e., the number of
    linearly independent rows of `a` can be less than, equal to, or
    greater than its number of linearly independent columns).  If `a`
    is square and of full rank, then `x` (but for round-off error) is
    the "exact" solution of the equation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (M, N) array_like
        "Coefficient" matrix.
    b : {(M,), (M, K)} array_like
        Ordinate or "dependent variable" values. If `b` is two-dimensional,
        the least-squares solution is calculated for each of the `K` columns
        of `b`.
    rcond : float, optional
        Cut-off ratio for small singular values of `a`.
        For the purposes of rank determination, singular values are treated
        as zero if they are smaller than `rcond` times the largest singular
        value of `a`.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.14.0
           If not set, a FutureWarning is given. The previous default
           of ``-1`` will use the machine precision as `rcond` parameter,
           the new default will use the machine precision times `max(M, N)`.
           To silence the warning and use the new default, use ``rcond=None``,
           to keep using the old behavior, use ``rcond=-1``.

    Returns
    -------
    x : {(N,), (N, K)} ndarray
        Least-squares solution. If `b` is two-dimensional,
        the solutions are in the `K` columns of `x`.
    residuals : {(1,), (K,), (0,)} ndarray
        Sums of residuals; squared Euclidean 2-norm for each column in
        ``b - a*x``.
        If the rank of `a` is < N or M <= N, this is an empty array.
        If `b` is 1-dimensional, this is a (1,) shape array.
        Otherwise the shape is (K,).
    rank : int
        Rank of matrix `a`.
    s : (min(M, N),) ndarray
        Singular values of `a`.

    Raises
    ------
    LinAlgError
        If computation does not converge.

    Notes
    -----
    If `b` is a matrix, then all array results are returned as matrices.

    Examples
    --------
    Fit a line, ``y = mx + c``, through some noisy data-points:

    >>> x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> y = np.array([-1, 0.2, 0.9, 2.1])

    By examining the coefficients, we see that the line should have a
    gradient of roughly 1 and cut the y-axis at, more or less, -1.

    We can rewrite the line equation as ``y = Ap``, where ``A = [[x 1]]``
    and ``p = [[m], [c]]``.  Now use `lstsq` to solve for `p`:

    >>> A = np.vstack([x, np.ones(len(x))]).T
    >>> A
    array([[ 0.,  1.],
           [ 1.,  1.],
           [ 2.,  1.],
           [ 3.,  1.]])

    >>> m, c = np.linalg.lstsq(A, y, rcond=None)[0]
    >>> print(m, c)
    1.0 -0.95

    Plot the data along with the fitted line:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> plt.plot(x, y, 'o', label='Original data', markersize=10)
    >>> plt.plot(x, m*x + c, 'r', label='Fitted line')
    >>> plt.legend()
    >>> plt.show()

    Rank of the array is the number of singular values of the array that are

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : {(M,), (..., M, N)} array_like
        input vector or stack of matrices
    tol : (...) array_like, float, optional
        threshold below which SVD values are considered zero. If `tol` is
        None, and ``S`` is an array with singular values for `M`, and
        ``eps`` is the epsilon value for datatype of ``S``, then `tol` is
        set to ``S.max() * max(M.shape) * eps``.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.14
           Broadcasted against the stack of matrices
    hermitian : bool, optional
        If True, `M` is assumed to be Hermitian (symmetric if real-valued),
        enabling a more efficient method for finding singular values.
        Defaults to False.

        .. versionadded:: 1.14

    Notes
    -----
    The default threshold to detect rank deficiency is a test on the magnitude
    of the singular values of `M`.  By default, we identify singular values less
    than ``S.max() * max(M.shape) * eps`` as indicating rank deficiency (with
    the symbols defined above). This is the algorithm MATLAB uses [1].  It also
    appears in *Numerical recipes* in the discussion of SVD solutions for linear
    least squares [2].

    This default threshold is designed to detect rank deficiency accounting for
    the numerical errors of the SVD computation.  Imagine that there is a column
    in `M` that is an exact (in floating point) linear combination of other
    columns in `M`. Computing the SVD on `M` will not produce a singular value
    exactly equal to 0 in general: any difference of the smallest SVD value from
    0 will be caused by numerical imprecision in the calculation of the SVD.
    Our threshold for small SVD values takes this numerical imprecision into
    account, and the default threshold will detect such numerical rank
    deficiency.  The threshold may declare a matrix `M` rank deficient even if
    the linear combination of some columns of `M` is not exactly equal to
    another column of `M` but only numerically very close to another column of
    `M`.

    We chose our default threshold because it is in wide use.  Other thresholds
    are possible.  For example, elsewhere in the 2007 edition of *Numerical
    recipes* there is an alternative threshold of ``S.max() *
    np.finfo(M.dtype).eps / 2. * np.sqrt(m + n + 1.)``. The authors describe
    this threshold as being based on "expected roundoff error" (p 71).

    The thresholds above deal with floating point roundoff error in the
    calculation of the SVD.  However, you may have more information about the
    sources of error in `M` that would make you consider other tolerance values
    to detect *effective* rank deficiency.  The most useful measure of the
    tolerance depends on the operations you intend to use on your matrix.  For
    example, if your data come from uncertain measurements with uncertainties
    greater than floating point epsilon, choosing a tolerance near that
    uncertainty may be preferable.  The tolerance may be absolute if the
    uncertainties are absolute rather than relative.

    Cholesky decomposition.

    Return the Cholesky decomposition, `L * L.H`, of the square matrix `a`,
    where `L` is lower-triangular and .H is the conjugate transpose operator
    (which is the ordinary transpose if `a` is real-valued).  `a` must be
    Hermitian (symmetric if real-valued) and positive-definite.  Only `L` is
    actually returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, M) array_like
        Hermitian (symmetric if all elements are real), positive-definite
        input matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    L : (..., M, M) array_like
        Upper or lower-triangular Cholesky factor of `a`.  Returns a
        matrix object if `a` is a matrix object.

    Raises

        They are not necessarily ordered, nor are they necessarily

    This is implemented using the _geev LAPACK routines which compute
    the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of general square arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    Illustration, using the fact that the eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix
    are its diagonal elements, that multiplying a matrix on the left
    by an orthogonal matrix, `Q`, and on the right by `Q.T` (the transpose
    of `Q`), preserves the eigenvalues of the "middle" matrix.  In other words,
    if `Q` is orthogonal, then ``Q * A * Q.T`` has the same eigenvalues as
    ``A``:

    >>> from numpy import linalg as LA
    >>> x = np.random.random()
    >>> Q = np.array([[np.cos(x), -np.sin(x)], [np.sin(x), np.cos(x)]])
    >>> LA.norm(Q[0, :]), LA.norm(Q[1, :]), np.dot(Q[0, :],Q[1, :])
    (1.0, 1.0, 0.0)

    Now multiply a diagonal matrix by Q on one side and by Q.T on the other:

    >>> D = np.diag((-1,1))
    >>> LA.eigvals(D)
    array([-1.,  1.])
    >>> A = np.dot(Q, D)
    >>> A = np.dot(A, Q.T)

    Raise a square matrix to the (integer) power `n`.

    For positive integers `n`, the power is computed by repeated matrix
    squarings and matrix multiplications. If ``n == 0``, the identity matrix
    of the same shape as M is returned. If ``n < 0``, the inverse
    is computed and then raised to the ``abs(n)``.

    .. note:: Stacks of object matrices are not currently supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, M) array_like
        Matrix to be "powered."
    n : int
        The exponent can be any integer or long integer, positive,
        negative, or zero.

    Returns
    -------
    a**n : (..., M, M) ndarray or matrix object
        The return value is the same shape and type as `M`;
        if the exponent is positive or zero then the type of the
        elements is the same as those of `M`. If the exponent is
        negative the elements are floating-point.

    Raises
    ------
    LinAlgError
        For matrices that are not square or that (for negative powers) cannot
        be inverted numerically.

        Input array to compute determinants for.

    Returns
    -------

    The determinant is computed via LU factorization using the LAPACK
    routine z/dgetrf.

    Examples
    --------
    The determinant of a 2-D array [[a, b], [c, d]] is ad - bc:

    >>> a = np.array([ [[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [2, 1]], [[1, 3], [3, 1]] ])
    >>> a.shape
    (3, 2, 2)
    >>> np.linalg.det(a)
    array([-2., -3., -8.])

    fmatmul_assertRank2
    Compute the 'inverse' of an N-dimensional array.

    The result is an inverse for `a` relative to the tensordot operation
    ``tensordot(a, b, ind)``, i. e., up to floating-point accuracy,
    ``tensordot(tensorinv(a), a, ind)`` is the "identity" tensor for the
    tensordot operation.

    Parameters
    ----------

    ind : int, optional
        Number of first indices that are involved in the inverse sum.
        Must be a positive integer, default is 2.

    Returns
    -------
    b : ndarray
        `a`'s tensordot inverse, shape ``a.shape[ind:] + a.shape[:ind]``.

    Raises
    ------

eigvalsh_up%s returns %dnan_maskeigvalsh_loCompute a function of the singular values of the 2-D matrices in `x`.

    This is a private utility function used by numpy.linalg.norm().

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray
    row_axis, col_axis : int
        The axes of `x` that hold the 2-D matrices.
    op : callable
        This should be either numpy.amin or numpy.amax or numpy.sum.

    Returns
    -------
    result : float or ndarray
        If `x` is 2-D, the return values is a float.
        Otherwise, it is an array with ``x.ndim - 2`` dimensions.
        The return values are either the minimum or maximum or sum of the
        singular values of the matrices, depending on whether `op`
        is `numpy.amin` or `numpy.amax` or `numpy.sum`.

    sqnorm
    Compute the eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of a square array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, M) array
        Matrices for which the eigenvalues and right eigenvectors will
        be computed

    Returns
    -------
    w : (..., M) array
        The eigenvalues, each repeated according to its multiplicity.
        The eigenvalues are not necessarily ordered. The resulting
        array will be of complex type, unless the imaginary part is
        zero in which case it will be cast to a real type. When `a`
        is real the resulting eigenvalues will be real (0 imaginary
        part) or occur in conjugate pairs

    v : (..., M, M) array
        The normalized (unit "length") eigenvectors, such that the
        column ``v[:,i]`` is the eigenvector corresponding to the
        eigenvalue ``w[i]``.

    Raises
    ------
    LinAlgError
        If the eigenvalue computation does not converge.

    See Also
    --------
    eigvals : eigenvalues of a non-symmetric array.

    eigh : eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a real symmetric or complex 
           Hermitian (conjugate symmetric) array.

    eigvalsh : eigenvalues of a real symmetric or complex Hermitian
               (conjugate symmetric) array.

    Notes
    -----

    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Broadcasting rules apply, see the `numpy.linalg` documentation for
    details.

    This is implemented using the _geev LAPACK routines which compute
    the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of general square arrays.

    The number `w` is an eigenvalue of `a` if there exists a vector
    `v` such that ``dot(a,v) = w * v``. Thus, the arrays `a`, `w`, and
    `v` satisfy the equations ``dot(a[:,:], v[:,i]) = w[i] * v[:,i]``
    for :math:`i \in \{0,...,M-1\}`.

    The array `v` of eigenvectors may not be of maximum rank, that is, some
    of the columns may be linearly dependent, although round-off error may
    obscure that fact. If the eigenvalues are all different, then theoretically
    the eigenvectors are linearly independent. Likewise, the (complex-valued)
    matrix of eigenvectors `v` is unitary if the matrix `a` is normal, i.e.,
    if ``dot(a, a.H) = dot(a.H, a)``, where `a.H` denotes the conjugate
    transpose of `a`.

    Finally, it is emphasized that `v` consists of the *right* (as in
    right-hand side) eigenvectors of `a`.  A vector `y` satisfying
    ``dot(y.T, a) = z * y.T`` for some number `z` is called a *left*
    eigenvector of `a`, and, in general, the left and right eigenvectors
    of a matrix are not necessarily the (perhaps conjugate) transposes
    of each other.

    Singular Value Decomposition.

    When `a` is a 2D array, it is factorized as ``u @ np.diag(s) @ vh
    = (u * s) @ vh``, where `u` and `vh` are 2D unitary arrays and `s` is a 1D
    array of `a`'s singular values. When `a` is higher-dimensional, SVD is
    applied in stacked mode as explained below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, N) array_like
        A real or complex array with ``a.ndim >= 2``.
    full_matrices : bool, optional
        If True (default), `u` and `vh` have the shapes ``(..., M, M)`` and
        ``(..., N, N)``, respectively.  Otherwise, the shapes are
        ``(..., M, K)`` and ``(..., K, N)``, respectively, where
        ``K = min(M, N)``.
    compute_uv : bool, optional
        Whether or not to compute `u` and `vh` in addition to `s`.  True
        by default.

    Returns
    -------
    u : { (..., M, M), (..., M, K) } array
        Unitary array(s). The first ``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions have the same
        size as those of the input `a`. The size of the last two dimensions
        depends on the value of `full_matrices`. Only returned when
        `compute_uv` is True.
    s : (..., K) array
        Vector(s) with the singular values, within each vector sorted in
        descending order. The first ``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions have the same
        size as those of the input `a`.
    vh : { (..., N, N), (..., K, N) } array
        Unitary array(s). The first ``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions have the same
        size as those of the input `a`. The size of the last two dimensions
        depends on the value of `full_matrices`. Only returned when
        `compute_uv` is True.

    Raises
    ------
    LinAlgError
        If SVD computation does not converge.

    -----

    .. versionchanged:: 1.8.0
       Broadcasting rules apply, see the `numpy.linalg` documentation for
       details.

    The decomposition is performed using LAPACK routine ``_gesdd``.

    SVD is usually described for the factorization of a 2D matrix :math:`A`.
    The higher-dimensional case will be discussed below. In the 2D case, SVD is
    written as :math:`A = U S V^H`, where :math:`A = a`, :math:`U= u`,
    :math:`S= \mathtt{np.diag}(s)` and :math:`V^H = vh`. The 1D array `s`
    contains the singular values of `a` and `u` and `vh` are unitary. The rows
    of `vh` are the eigenvectors of :math:`A^H A` and the columns of `u` are
    the eigenvectors of :math:`A A^H`. In both cases the corresponding
    (possibly non-zero) eigenvalues are given by ``s**2``.

    If `a` has more than two dimensions, then broadcasting rules apply, as
    explained in :ref:`routines.linalg-broadcasting`. This means that SVD is
    working in "stacked" mode: it iterates over all indices of the first
    ``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions and for each combination SVD is applied to the
    last two indices. The matrix `a` can be reconstructed from the
    decomposition with either ``(u * s[..., None, :]) @ vh`` or
    ``u @ (s[..., None] * vh)``. (The ``@`` operator can be replaced by the
    function ``np.matmul`` for python versions below 3.5.)

    If `a` is a ``matrix`` object (as opposed to an ``ndarray``), then so are
    all the return values.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.random.randn(9, 6) + 1j*np.random.randn(9, 6)
    >>> b = np.random.randn(2, 7, 8, 3) + 1j*np.random.randn(2, 7, 8, 3)

    Reconstruction based on full SVD, 2D case:

    >>> u, s, vh = np.linalg.svd(a, full_matrices=True)
    >>> u.shape, s.shape, vh.shape
    ((9, 9), (6,), (6, 6))
    >>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(u[:, :6] * s, vh))
    True
    >>> smat = np.zeros((9, 6), dtype=complex)
    >>> smat[:6, :6] = np.diag(s)
    >>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(u, np.dot(smat, vh)))
    True

    Reconstruction based on reduced SVD, 2D case:

    >>> u, s, vh = np.linalg.svd(a, full_matrices=False)
    >>> u.shape, s.shape, vh.shape
    ((9, 6), (6,), (6, 6))
    >>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(u * s, vh))
    True
    >>> smat = np.diag(s)
    >>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(u, np.dot(smat, vh)))
    True

    Reconstruction based on full SVD, 4D case:

    >>> u, s, vh = np.linalg.svd(b, full_matrices=True)
    >>> u.shape, s.shape, vh.shape
    ((2, 7, 8, 8), (2, 7, 3), (2, 7, 3, 3))
    >>> np.allclose(b, np.matmul(u[..., :3] * s[..., None, :], vh))
    True
    >>> np.allclose(b, np.matmul(u[..., :3], s[..., None] * vh))
    True

    Reconstruction based on reduced SVD, 4D case:

    >>> u, s, vh = np.linalg.svd(b, full_matrices=False)
    >>> u.shape, s.shape, vh.shape
    ((2, 7, 8, 3), (2, 7, 3), (2, 7, 3, 3))
    >>> np.allclose(b, np.matmul(u * s[..., None, :], vh))
    True
    >>> np.allclose(b, np.matmul(u, s[..., None] * vh))
    True

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, N) array_like
        Matrix or stack of matrices to be pseudo-inverted.
    rcond : (...) array_like of float
        Cutoff for small singular values.
        Singular values smaller (in modulus) than
        `rcond` * largest_singular_value (again, in modulus)
        are set to zero. Broadcasts against the stack of matrices

    Returns
    -------
    B : (..., N, M) ndarray
        The pseudo-inverse of `a`. If `a` is a `matrix` instance, then so
        is `B`.

    Raises
    ------
    LinAlgError
        If the SVD computation does not converge.

    Notes
    -----
    The pseudo-inverse of a matrix A, denoted :math:`A^+`, is
    defined as: "the matrix that 'solves' [the least-squares problem]
    :math:`Ax = b`," i.e., if :math:`\bar{x}` is said solution, then
    :math:`A^+` is that matrix such that :math:`\bar{x} = A^+b`.

    It can be shown that if :math:`Q_1 \Sigma Q_2^T = A` is the singular
    value decomposition of A, then
    :math:`A^+ = Q_2 \Sigma^+ Q_1^T`, where :math:`Q_{1,2}` are
    orthogonal matrices, :math:`\Sigma` is a diagonal matrix consisting
    of A's so-called singular values, (followed, typically, by
    zeros), and then :math:`\Sigma^+` is simply the diagonal matrix
    consisting of the reciprocals of A's singular values
    (again, followed by zeros). [1]_

    `multi_dot` chains `numpy.dot` and uses optimal parenthesization
    of the matrices [1]_ [2]_. Depending on the shapes of the matrices,
    this can speed up the multiplication a lot.

    If the last argument is 1-D it is treated as a column vector.
    The other arguments must be 2-D.

    The cost for a matrix multiplication can be calculated with the
    following function::

        def cost(A, B):
            return A.shape[0] * A.shape[1] * B.shape[1]

    Let's assume we have three matrices
    :math:`A_{10x100}, B_{100x5}, C_{5x50}`.

    The costs for the two different parenthesizations are as follows::

        cost((AB)C) = 10*100*5 + 10*5*50   = 5000 + 2500   = 7500
        cost(A(BC)) = 10*100*50 + 100*5*50 = 50000 + 25000 = 75000

        Coefficient matrix.
    b : {(..., M,), (..., M, K)}, array_like
        Ordinate or "dependent variable" values.

    Returns
    -------
    x : {(..., M,), (..., M, K)} ndarray
        Solution to the system a x = b.  Returned shape is identical to `b`.

    Raises

    The solutions are computed using LAPACK routine _gesv

    `a` must be square and of full-rank, i.e., all rows (or, equivalently,
    columns) must be linearly independent; if either is not true, use
    `lstsq` for the least-squares best "solution" of the
    system/equation.

    Solve the tensor equation ``a x = b`` for x.

    It is assumed that all indices of `x` are summed over in the product,
    together with the rightmost indices of `a`, as is done in, for example,
    ``tensordot(a, x, axes=b.ndim)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Coefficient tensor, of shape ``b.shape + Q``. `Q`, a tuple, equals
        the shape of that sub-tensor of `a` consisting of the appropriate
        number of its rightmost indices, and must be such that
        ``prod(Q) == prod(b.shape)`` (in which sense `a` is said to be
        'square').
    b : array_like
        Right-hand tensor, which can be of any shape.
    axes : tuple of ints, optional
        Axes in `a` to reorder to the right, before inversion.
        If None (default), no reordering is done.

Masked Arrays
=============

Arrays sometimes contain invalid or missing data.  When doing operations
on such arrays, we wish to suppress invalid values, which is the purpose masked
arrays fulfill (an example of typical use is given below).

For example, examine the following array:

>>> x = np.array([2, 1, 3, np.nan, 5, 2, 3, np.nan])

When we try to calculate the mean of the data, the result is undetermined:

>>> np.mean(x)
nan

The mean is calculated using roughly ``np.sum(x)/len(x)``, but since
any number added to ``NaN`` [1]_ produces ``NaN``, this doesn't work.  Enter
masked arrays:

>>> m = np.ma.masked_array(x, np.isnan(x))
>>> m
masked_array(data = [2.0 1.0 3.0 -- 5.0 2.0 3.0 --],
      mask = [False False False  True False False False  True],
      fill_value=1e+20)

Here, we construct a masked array that suppress all ``NaN`` values.  We
may now proceed to calculate the mean of the other values:

>>> np.mean(m)
2.6666666666666665

    taking the maximum of an array with a given dtype.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : ndarray, dtype or scalar
        An object that can be queried for it's numeric type.

    MaskedArray.__rpow__MaskedConstant.__has_singletonMaskedArray.get_realMaskedArray.__iadd____float__
    Return all the non-masked data as a 1-D array.

    This function is equivalent to calling the "compressed" method of a
    `MaskedArray`, see `MaskedArray.compressed` for details.

    See Also
    --------
    MaskedArray.compressed
        Equivalent method.

    Flat version of the array.MaskedArray.tolistCheck whether other does not equal self elementwise.

        When either of the elements is masked, the result is masked as well,
        but the underlying boolean data are still set, with self and other
        considered equal if both are masked, and unequal otherwise.

        For structured arrays, all fields are combined, with masked values
        ignored. The result is masked if all fields were masked, with self
        and other considered equal only if both were fully masked.

    This function is a shortcut to ``masked_where``, with
    `condition` = (x <= value).

    See Also
    --------
    masked_where : Mask where a condition is met.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma

    array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> ma.masked_less_equal(a, 2)
    masked_array(data = [-- -- -- 3],
          mask = [ True  True  True False],
          fill_value=999999)

    Returns the filled array, or True if masked.
        Return the mask of the records.

        A record is masked when all the fields are masked.

        MaskedArray.tracefilly
        Create a new masked array from scratch.

        Notes
        -----
        A masked array can also be created by taking a .view(MaskedArray).

        mvoid._get_data
    Returns True if two arrays are element-wise equal within a tolerance.

    This function is equivalent to `allclose` except that masked values
    are treated as equal (default) or unequal, depending on the `masked_equal`
    argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : array_like
        Input arrays to compare.
    masked_equal : bool, optional
        Whether masked values in `a` and `b` are considered equal (True) or not
        (False). They are considered equal by default.
    rtol : float, optional
        Relative tolerance. The relative difference is equal to ``rtol * b``.
        Default is 1e-5.
    atol : float, optional
        Absolute tolerance. The absolute difference is equal to `atol`.
        Default is 1e-8.

    Returns
    -------
    y : bool
        Returns True if the two arrays are equal within the given
        tolerance, False otherwise. If either array contains NaN, then
        False is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    all, any
    numpy.allclose : the non-masked `allclose`.

    Notes
    -----
    If the following equation is element-wise True, then `allclose` returns
    True::

      absolute(`a` - `b`) <= (`atol` + `rtol` * absolute(`b`))

    Return True if all elements of `a` and `b` are equal subject to
    given tolerances.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = ma.array([1e10, 1e-7, 42.0], mask=[0, 0, 1])
    >>> a
    masked_array(data = [10000000000.0 1e-07 --],
                 mask = [False False  True],
           fill_value = 1e+20)
    >>> b = ma.array([1e10, 1e-8, -42.0], mask=[0, 0, 1])
    >>> ma.allclose(a, b)
    False

    >>> a = ma.array([1e10, 1e-8, 42.0], mask=[0, 0, 1])
    >>> b = ma.array([1.00001e10, 1e-9, -42.0], mask=[0, 0, 1])
    >>> ma.allclose(a, b)
    True
    >>> ma.allclose(a, b, masked_equal=False)
    False

    Masked values are not compared directly.

    >>> a = ma.array([1e10, 1e-8, 42.0], mask=[0, 0, 1])
    >>> b = ma.array([1.00001e10, 1e-9, 42.0], mask=[0, 0, 1])
    >>> ma.allclose(a, b)
    True
    >>> ma.allclose(a, b, masked_equal=False)
    False

    
    Return the default fill value for the argument object.

    The default filling value depends on the datatype of the input
    array or the type of the input scalar:

       ========  ========
       datatype  default
       ========  ========
       bool      True
       int       999999

       complex   1.e20+0j
       object    '?'
       string    'N/A'
       ========  ========

    For structured types, a structured scalar is returned, with each field the
    default fill value for its type.

    For subarray types, the fill value is an array of the same size containing
    the default scalar fill value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : ndarray, dtype or scalar
        The array data-type or scalar for which the default fill value
        is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    fill_value : scalar
        The default fill value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.ma.default_fill_value(1)
    999999
    >>> np.ma.default_fill_value(np.array([1.1, 2., np.pi]))
    1e+20
    >>> np.ma.default_fill_value(np.dtype(complex))
    (1e+20+0j)

    flatten_sequence_mask_dtype
        Return the array data as a string containing the raw bytes in the array.

        The array is filled with a fill value before the string conversion.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

        Parameters
        ----------
        fill_value : scalar, optional
            Value used to fill in the masked values. Default is None, in which
            case `MaskedArray.fill_value` is used.
        order : {'C','F','A'}, optional
            Order of the data item in the copy. Default is 'C'.

            - 'C'   -- C order (row major).
            - 'F'   -- Fortran order (column major).
            - 'A'   -- Any, current order of array.
            - None  -- Same as 'A'.

        Notes
        -----
        As for `ndarray.tobytes`, information about the shape, dtype, etc.,
        but also about `fill_value`, will be lost.

        Examples

        MaskedArray.dtypedom_maskshort_stdGenerates a flattened version of the sequence.÷ÿÿÿÿÿï¿MaskedArray.meanidtypemvoid.__new__
    Concatenate a sequence of arrays along the given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arrays : sequence of array_like
        The arrays must have the same shape, except in the dimension
        corresponding to `axis` (the first, by default).
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which the arrays will be joined. Default is 0.

        Sort the array, in-place

        Parameters
        ----------
        a : array_like
            Array to be sorted.
        axis : int, optional
            Axis along which to sort. If None, the array is flattened before
            sorting. The default is -1, which sorts along the last axis.
        kind : {'quicksort', 'mergesort', 'heapsort', 'stable'}, optional
            Sorting algorithm. Default is 'quicksort'.
        order : list, optional
            When `a` is a structured array, this argument specifies which fields
            to compare first, second, and so on.  This list does not need to
            include all of the fields.
        endwith : {True, False}, optional
            Whether missing values (if any) should be treated as the largest values
            (True) or the smallest values (False)
            When the array contains unmasked values at the same extremes of the
            datatype, the ordering of these values and the masked values is
            undefined.
        fill_value : {var}, optional
            Value used internally for the masked values.
            If ``fill_value`` is not None, it supersedes ``endwith``.

    a : array_like
        Input data, in any form that can be converted to an array.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        By default, the data-type is inferred from the input data.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr
        The array which argsort was called on

    np.ma.argsort has a long-term bug where the default of the axis argument
    is wrong (gh-8701), which now must be kept for backwards compatibiity.

        Parameters
        ----------
        axis : int, optional
            Axis along which to sort. If None, the default, the flattened array
            is used.

            ..  versionchanged:: 1.13.0
                Previously, the default was documented to be -1, but that was
                in error. At some future date, the default will change to -1, as
                originally intended.
                Until then, the axis should be given explicitly when
                ``arr.ndim > 1``, to avoid a FutureWarning.
        kind : {'quicksort', 'mergesort', 'heapsort', 'stable'}, optional
            Sorting algorithm.
        order : list, optional
            When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument specifies
            which fields to compare first, second, etc.  Not all fields need be
            specified.
        endwith : {True, False}, optional
            Whether missing values (if any) should be treated as the largest values
            (True) or the smallest values (False)

            datatype, the ordering of these values and the masked values is
            undefined.
        fill_value : {var}, optional
            Value used internally for the masked values.
            If ``fill_value`` is not None, it supersedes ``endwith``.

        Returns
        -------
        index_array : ndarray, int
            Array of indices that sort `a` along the specified axis.
            In other words, ``a[index_array]`` yields a sorted `a`.

            Value used to fill in the masked values.  If None, the output of
            minimum_fill_value(self._data) is used instead.
        out : {None, array}, optional
            Array into which the result can be placed. Its type is preserved
            and it must be of the right shape to hold the output.

    An array class with possibly masked values.

    Masked values of True exclude the corresponding element from any
    computation.

    Construction::

      x = MaskedArray(data, mask=nomask, dtype=None, copy=False, subok=True,
                      ndmin=0, fill_value=None, keep_mask=True, hard_mask=None,
                      shrink=True, order=None)

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array_like
        Input data.
    mask : sequence, optional
        Mask. Must be convertible to an array of booleans with the same
        shape as `data`. True indicates a masked (i.e. invalid) data.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Data type of the output.
        If `dtype` is None, the type of the data argument (``data.dtype``)
        is used. If `dtype` is not None and different from ``data.dtype``,
        a copy is performed.
    copy : bool, optional
        Whether to copy the input data (True), or to use a reference instead.
        Default is False.
    subok : bool, optional
        Whether to return a subclass of `MaskedArray` if possible (True) or a
        plain `MaskedArray`. Default is True.
    ndmin : int, optional
        Minimum number of dimensions. Default is 0.
    fill_value : scalar, optional
        Value used to fill in the masked values when necessary.
        If None, a default based on the data-type is used.
    keep_mask : bool, optional
        Whether to combine `mask` with the mask of the input data, if any
        (True), or to use only `mask` for the output (False). Default is True.
    hard_mask : bool, optional
        Whether to use a hard mask or not. With a hard mask, masked values
        cannot be unmasked. Default is False.
    shrink : bool, optional
        Whether to force compression of an empty mask. Default is True.
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A'}, optional
        Specify the order of the array.  If order is 'C', then the array
        will be in C-contiguous order (last-index varies the fastest).
        If order is 'F', then the returned array will be in
        Fortran-contiguous order (first-index varies the fastest).
        If order is 'A' (default), then the returned array may be
        in any order (either C-, Fortran-contiguous, or even discontiguous),
        unless a copy is required, in which case it will be C-contiguous.

    flatten_mask.<locals>._flatsequenceinitialdocMaskedArray.dot_flatmaskmasked_inside
    Shift the bits of an integer to the right.

    This is the masked array version of `numpy.right_shift`, for details
    see that function.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.right_shift

    _extrema_operation.outerDefines an iterator for mvoid_MaskedBinaryOperation.outer
    Set storage-indexed locations to corresponding values.

    This function is equivalent to `MaskedArray.put`, see that method
    for details.

    See Also
    --------
    MaskedArray.put

    MaskedArray.__setitem__DomainGreater(v)(x) = true where x <= v
    Return the dot product of two arrays.

    This function is the equivalent of `numpy.dot` that takes masked values
    into account. Note that `strict` and `out` are in different position
    than in the method version. In order to maintain compatibility with the
    corresponding method, it is recommended that the optional arguments be
    treated as keyword only.  At some point that may be mandatory.

    .. note::
      Works only with 2-D arrays at the moment.


    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : masked_array_like
        Inputs arrays.
    strict : bool, optional
        Whether masked data are propagated (True) or set to 0 (False) for
        the computation. Default is False.  Propagating the mask means that
        if a masked value appears in a row or column, the whole row or
        column is considered masked.
    out : masked_array, optional
        Output argument. This must have the exact kind that would be returned
        if it was not used. In particular, it must have the right type, must be
        C-contiguous, and its dtype must be the dtype that would be returned
        for `dot(a,b)`. This is a performance feature. Therefore, if these
        conditions are not met, an exception is raised, instead of attempting
        to be flexible.

    Cannot alter the masked element.
    Return a new masked array with the specified size and shape.

    This is the masked equivalent of the `numpy.resize` function. The new
    array is filled with repeated copies of `x` (in the order that the
    data are stored in memory). If `x` is masked, the new array will be
    masked, and the new mask will be a repetition of the old one.

    See Also
    --------
    masked_where : Mask where a condition is met.

    Compare self with other using operator.eq or operator.ne.

        When either of the elements is masked, the result is masked as well,
        but the underlying boolean data are still set, with self and other
        considered equal if both are masked, and unequal otherwise.

        For structured arrays, all fields are combined, with masked values
        ignored. The result is masked if all fields were masked, with self
        and other considered equal only if both were fully masked.

    Return the mask of a masked array, or nomask.

    Return the mask of `a` as an ndarray if `a` is a `MaskedArray` and the
    mask is not `nomask`, else return `nomask`. To guarantee a full array
    of booleans of the same shape as a, use `getmaskarray`.

    Parameters

    a : array_like
        Input `MaskedArray` for which the mask is required.

    Return a class method wrapper around a basic array method.

    Creates a class method which returns a masked array, where the new
    ``_data`` array is the output of the corresponding basic method called
    on the original ``_data``.

    If `onmask` is True, the new mask is the output of the method called
    on the initial mask. Otherwise, the new mask is just a reference
    to the initial mask.

    Parameters
    ----------
    funcname : str
        Name of the function to apply on data.
    onmask : bool
        Whether the mask must be processed also (True) or left
        alone (False). Default is True. Make available as `_onmask`
        attribute.

    Returns
    -------
    method : instancemethod
        Class method wrapper of the specified basic array method.

    mindxOnly length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalarsmasked_trchoose.<locals>.nmask
        x.__setitem__(i, y) <==> x[i]=y

        Set item described by index. If value is masked, masks those
        locations.

        
    Define a valid interval for the `tan` function, so that:

    ``domain_tan(eps) = True`` where ``abs(cos(x)) < eps``

    
        Copy the mask and set the sharedmask flag to False.

        Whether the mask is shared between masked arrays can be seen from
        the `sharedmask` property. `unshare_mask` ensures the mask is not shared.
        A copy of the mask is only made if it was shared.

    Construct a dtype description list from a given dtype.

    Returns a new dtype object, with the type of all fields in `ndtype` to a
    boolean type. Field names are not altered.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ndtype : dtype
        The dtype to convert.

    Returns
    -------
    result : dtype
        A dtype that looks like `ndtype`, the type of all fields is boolean.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma
    >>> dtype = np.dtype({'names':['foo', 'bar'],
                          'formats':[np.float32, int]})

    Helper function for ma.correlate and ma.convolve
    Flatten the mask and returns a (maybe nested) sequence of booleans.
        Give a new shape to the array without changing its data.

        Returns a masked array containing the same data, but with a new shape.
        The result is a view on the original array; if this is not possible, a
        ValueError is raised.

        Parameters
        ----------
        shape : int or tuple of ints
            The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If an
            integer is supplied, then the result will be a 1-D array of that
            length.
        order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
            Determines whether the array data should be viewed as in C
            (row-major) or FORTRAN (column-major) order.

        Returns
        -------
        reshaped_array : array
            A new view on the array.

        Notes
        -----
        The reshaping operation cannot guarantee that a copy will not be made,
        to modify the shape in place, use ``a.shape = s``

        Examples
        --------
        >>> x = np.ma.array([[1,2],[3,4]], mask=[1,0,0,1])

    Return input with invalid data masked and replaced by a fill value.

    Invalid data means values of `nan`, `inf`, etc.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array, a (subclass of) ndarray.
    mask : sequence, optional
        Mask. Must be convertible to an array of booleans with the same
        shape as `data`. True indicates a masked (i.e. invalid) data.
    copy : bool, optional
        Whether to use a copy of `a` (True) or to fix `a` in place (False).
        Default is True.
    fill_value : scalar, optional
        Value used for fixing invalid data. Default is None, in which case
        the ``a.fill_value`` is used.

    Returns
    -------
    b : MaskedArray
        The input array with invalid entries fixed.

    Notes
    -----
    A copy is performed by default.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.ma.array([1., -1, np.nan, np.inf], mask=[1] + [0]*3)
    >>> x
    masked_array(data = [-- -1.0 nan inf],

    This is the masked array version of `numpy.putmask`, for details see
    `numpy.putmask`.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.putmask

    Notes
    -----
    Using a masked array as `values` will **not** transform a `ndarray` into
    a `MaskedArray`.

    cshape
        Return a view of the MaskedArray data

        Parameters
        ----------
        dtype : data-type or ndarray sub-class, optional
            Data-type descriptor of the returned view, e.g., float32 or int16.
            The default, None, results in the view having the same data-type
            as `a`. As with ``ndarray.view``, dtype can also be specified as
            an ndarray sub-class, which then specifies the type of the
            returned object (this is equivalent to setting the ``type``
            parameter).
        type : Python type, optional
            Type of the returned view, either ndarray or a subclass.  The
            default None results in type preservation.

        Notes
        -----

        ``a.view()`` is used two different ways:

        ``a.view(some_dtype)`` or ``a.view(dtype=some_dtype)`` constructs a view
        of the array's memory with a different data-type.  This can cause a
        reinterpretation of the bytes of memory.

        ``a.view(ndarray_subclass)`` or ``a.view(type=ndarray_subclass)`` just
        returns an instance of `ndarray_subclass` that looks at the same array
        (same shape, dtype, etc.)  This does not cause a reinterpretation of the
        memory.

        If `fill_value` is not specified, but `dtype` is specified (and is not
        an ndarray sub-class), the `fill_value` of the MaskedArray will be
        reset. If neither `fill_value` nor `dtype` are specified (or if
        `dtype` is an ndarray sub-class), then the fill value is preserved.
        Finally, if `fill_value` is specified, but `dtype` is not, the fill
        value is set to the specified value.

        For ``a.view(some_dtype)``, if ``some_dtype`` has a different number of
        bytes per entry than the previous dtype (for example, converting a
        regular array to a structured array), then the behavior of the view
        cannot be predicted just from the superficial appearance of ``a`` (shown
        by ``print(a)``). It also depends on exactly how ``a`` is stored in
        memory. Therefore if ``a`` is C-ordered versus fortran-ordered, versus
        defined as a slice or transpose, etc., the view may give different
        results.
        
        Returns a 1D version of self, as a view.

        Parameters
        ----------
        order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
            The elements of `a` are read using this index order. 'C' means to
            index the elements in C-like order, with the last axis index
            changing fastest, back to the first axis index changing slowest.
            'F' means to index the elements in Fortran-like index order, with
            the first index changing fastest, and the last index changing
            slowest. Note that the 'C' and 'F' options take no account of the
            memory layout of the underlying array, and only refer to the order
            of axis indexing.  'A' means to read the elements in Fortran-like
            index order if `m` is Fortran *contiguous* in memory, C-like order
            otherwise.  'K' means to read the elements in the order they occur
            in memory, except for reversing the data when strides are negative.
            By default, 'C' index order is used.

        Returns
        -------
        MaskedArray
            Output view is of shape ``(self.size,)`` (or
            ``(np.ma.product(self.shape),)``).

        Examples
        --------
        >>> x = np.ma.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], mask=[0] + [1,0]*4)
        >>> print(x)
        [[1 -- 3]
         [-- 5 --]
         [7 -- 9]]
        >>> print(x.ravel())
        [1 -- 3 -- 5 -- 7 -- 9]

        mbfunclong_std
    DomainGreaterEqual(v)(x) is True where x < v.

    
    Flat iterator object to iterate over masked arrays.

    A `MaskedIterator` iterator is returned by ``x.flat`` for any masked array
    `x`. It allows iterating over the array as if it were a 1-D array,
    either in a for-loop or by calling its `next` method.

    Iteration is done in C-contiguous style, with the last index varying the
    fastest. The iterator can also be indexed using basic slicing or
    advanced indexing.

    See Also
    --------
    MaskedArray.flat : Return a flat iterator over an array.
    MaskedArray.flatten : Returns a flattened copy of an array.

    Notes
    -----
    `MaskedIterator` is not exported by the `ma` module. Instead of
    instantiating a `MaskedIterator` directly, use `MaskedArray.flat`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.ma.array(arange(6).reshape(2, 3))
    >>> fl = x.flat
    >>> type(fl)
    <class 'numpy.ma.core.MaskedIterator'>
    >>> for item in fl:
    ...     print(item)
    ...
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5

    Extracting more than a single element b indexing the `MaskedIterator`
    returns a masked array:

    >>> fl[2:4]
    masked_array(data = [2 3],
                 mask = False,
           fill_value = 999999)

    Mask an array where invalid values occur (NaNs or infs).

    This function is a shortcut to ``masked_where``, with
    `condition` = ~(np.isfinite(a)). Any pre-existing mask is conserved.
    Only applies to arrays with a dtype where NaNs or infs make sense
    (i.e. floating point types), but accepts any array_like object.

    Warning: 'argpartition' will ignore the 'mask' of the {}._MaskedConstant__has_singleton
        Return a copy with masked fields filled with a given value.

        Parameters
        ----------
        fill_value : scalar, optional
            The value to use for invalid entries (None by default).
            If None, the `fill_value` attribute is used instead.

        Returns
        -------
        filled_void
            A `np.void` object

        See Also
        --------
        MaskedArray.filled

        MaskedArray.soften_mask
    Return a copy of a, rounded to 'decimals' places.

    When 'decimals' is negative, it specifies the number of positions
    to the left of the decimal point.  The real and imaginary parts of
    complex numbers are rounded separately. Nothing is done if the
    array is not of float type and 'decimals' is greater than or equal
    to 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    decimals : int
        Number of decimals to round to. May be negative.
    out : array_like
        Existing array to use for output.
        If not given, returns a default copy of a.

    -----
    If out is given and does not have a mask attribute, the mask of a
    is lost!

    Define masked version of binary operations, where invalid
    values are pre-masked.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mbfunc : function
        The function for which to define a masked version. Made available
        as ``_MaskedBinaryOperation.f``.
    domain : class instance
        Default domain for the function. Should be one of the ``_Domain*``
        classes. Default is None.
    fillx : scalar, optional
        Filling value for the first argument, default is 0.
    filly : scalar, optional
        Filling value for the second argument, default is 0.

    domain_check_interval(a,b)(x) = true where x < a or y > b
        Copies some attributes of obj to self.

        Imaginary part.MaskedIterator.__setitem__MaskedArray.__truediv__curmask_convolve_or_correlateCheck whether other equals self elementwise.

        When either of the elements is masked, the result is masked as well,
        but the underlying boolean data are still set, with self and other
        considered equal if both are masked, and unequal otherwise.

        For structured arrays, all fields are combined, with masked values
        ignored. The result is masked if all fields were masked, with self
        and other considered equal only if both were fully masked.
        _convert2ma.__init__
    Recursively fill `a` with `fill_value`.

    
    Shortcut to MaskedArray.

    The options are in a different order for convenience and backwards
    compatibility.

    
    Class for mask related errors.

    
    maskedarray version of the numpy function.

    
        Flattens a compound of nested iterables.

        
    Test whether input is an instance of MaskedArray.

    This function returns True if `x` is an instance of MaskedArray
    and returns False otherwise.  Any object is accepted as input.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : object
        Object to test.

    Returns
    -------
    result : bool
        True if `x` is a MaskedArray.

    MaskedArray.__idiv___legacy_print_templates
        This function is a compatibility alias for tobytes. Despite its name it
        returns bytes not strings.
        MaskedArray.__ne__
        Count the non-masked elements of the array along the given axis.

        Parameters
        ----------
        axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
            Axis or axes along which the count is performed.
            The default (`axis` = `None`) performs the count over all
            the dimensions of the input array. `axis` may be negative, in
            which case it counts from the last to the first axis.

            .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

            If this is a tuple of ints, the count is performed on multiple
            axes, instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
        keepdims : bool, optional
            If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
            in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
            the result will broadcast correctly against the array.

        Returns
        -------
        result : ndarray or scalar
            An array with the same shape as the input array, with the specified
            axis removed. If the array is a 0-d array, or if `axis` is None, a
            scalar is returned.

        See Also
        --------
        count_masked : Count masked elements in array or along a given axis.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> import numpy.ma as ma
        >>> a = ma.arange(6).reshape((2, 3))
        >>> a[1, :] = ma.masked
        >>> a
        masked_array(data =
         [[0 1 2]

         [[False False False]
         [ True  True  True]],
               fill_value = 999999)
        >>> a.count()
        3

        When the `axis` keyword is specified an array of appropriate size is
        returned.

        >>> a.count(axis=0)
        array([1, 1, 1])
        >>> a.count(axis=1)
        array([3, 0])

        Return the data portion of the masked array as a hierarchical Python list.

        Data items are converted to the nearest compatible Python type.
        Masked values are converted to `fill_value`. If `fill_value` is None,
        the corresponding entries in the output list will be ``None``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        fill_value : scalar, optional
            The value to use for invalid entries. Default is None.

        Returns
        -------
        result : list
            The Python list representation of the masked array.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> x = np.ma.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], mask=[0] + [1,0]*4)

        >>> x.tolist(-999)
        [[1, -999, 3], [-999, 5, -999], [7, -999, 9]]

        Append values to the end of an array.

    .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Values are appended to a copy of this array.
    b : array_like
        These values are appended to a copy of `a`.  It must be of the
        correct shape (the same shape as `a`, excluding `axis`).  If `axis`
        is not specified, `b` can be any shape and will be flattened
        before use.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which `v` are appended.  If `axis` is not given,
        both `a` and `b` are flattened before use.

    Returns
    -------
    append : MaskedArray
        A copy of `a` with `b` appended to `axis`.  Note that `append`
        does not occur in-place: a new array is allocated and filled.  If
        `axis` is None, the result is a flattened array.

        %(nlen)s  fill_value = %(fill)s,
        %(nlen)s       dtype = %(dtype)s)
        
    Create a boolean mask from an array.

    Return `m` as a boolean mask, creating a copy if necessary or requested.
    The function can accept any sequence that is convertible to integers,
    or ``nomask``.  Does not require that contents must be 0s and 1s, values
    of 0 are interepreted as False, everything else as True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : array_like
        Potential mask.
    copy : bool, optional
        Whether to return a copy of `m` (True) or `m` itself (False).
    shrink : bool, optional
        Whether to shrink `m` to ``nomask`` if all its values are False.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Data-type of the output mask. By default, the output mask has a
        dtype of MaskType (bool). If the dtype is flexible, each field has
        a boolean dtype. This is ignored when `m` is ``nomask``, in which
        case ``nomask`` is always returned.

    Returns
    -------
    result : ndarray
        A boolean mask derived from `m`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma
    >>> m = [True, False, True, True]
    >>> ma.make_mask(m)
    array([ True, False,  True,  True])
    >>> m = [1, 0, 1, 1]
    >>> ma.make_mask(m)
    array([ True, False,  True,  True])
    >>> m = [1, 0, 2, -3]
    >>> ma.make_mask(m)
    array([ True, False,  True,  True])

    Effect of the `shrink` parameter.

    >>> m = np.zeros(4)
    >>> m
    array([ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.])
    >>> ma.make_mask(m)
    False
    >>> ma.make_mask(m, shrink=False)
    array([False, False, False, False])

    Using a flexible `dtype`.

    >>> m = [1, 0, 1, 1]
    >>> n = [0, 1, 0, 0]

numpy.ma : a package to handle missing or invalid values.

This package was initially written for numarray by Paul F. Dubois
at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
In 2006, the package was completely rewritten by Pierre Gerard-Marchant
(University of Georgia) to make the MaskedArray class a subclass of ndarray,
and to improve support of structured arrays.

.. moduleauthor:: Pierre Gerard-Marchant


        Returns True if any of the elements of `a` evaluate to True.

        Masked values are considered as False during computation.

        Refer to `numpy.any` for full documentation.

        See Also
        --------
        ndarray.any : corresponding function for ndarrays
        numpy.any : equivalent function

        MaskedArray.nonzero
        Raise self to the power other, in place.

        masked_singletonmin_valueMaskedArray._set_flat
    Mask the array `x` where the data are exactly equal to value.

    This function is similar to `masked_values`, but only suitable
    for object arrays: for floating point, use `masked_values` instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Array to mask
    value : object
        Comparison value
    copy : {True, False}, optional
        Whether to return a copy of `x`.
    shrink : {True, False}, optional
        Whether to collapse a mask full of False to nomask

    Returns
    -------
    result : MaskedArray
        The result of masking `x` where equal to `value`.

    See Also
    --------
    masked_where : Mask where a condition is met.
    masked_equal : Mask where equal to a given value (integers).
    masked_values : Mask using floating point equality.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma
    >>> food = np.array(['green_eggs', 'ham'], dtype=object)
    >>> # don't eat spoiled food
    >>> eat = ma.masked_object(food, 'green_eggs')
    >>> print(eat)
    [-- ham]
    >>> # plain ol` ham is boring
    >>> fresh_food = np.array(['cheese', 'ham', 'pineapple'], dtype=object)
    >>> eat = ma.masked_object(fresh_food, 'green_eggs')
    >>> print(eat)
    [cheese ham pineapple]

    Note that `mask` is set to ``nomask`` if possible.

    >>> eat
    masked_array(data = [cheese ham pineapple],
          mask = False,
          fill_value=?)

    
        Transforms a masked array into a flexible-type array.

        The flexible type array that is returned will have two fields:

        * the ``_data`` field stores the ``_data`` part of the array.
        * the ``_mask`` field stores the ``_mask`` part of the array.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None

        Returns
        -------
        record : ndarray
            A new flexible-type `ndarray` with two fields: the first element
            containing a value, the second element containing the corresponding
            mask boolean. The returned record shape matches self.shape.

        Notes
        -----
        A side-effect of transforming a masked array into a flexible `ndarray` is
        that meta information (``fill_value``, ...) will be lost.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> x = np.ma.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], mask=[0] + [1,0]*4)
        >>> print(x)
        [[1 -- 3]
         [-- 5 --]
         [7 -- 9]]
        >>> print(x.toflex())
        [[(1, False) (2, True) (3, False)]
         [(4, True) (5, False) (6, True)]
         [(7, False) (8, True) (9, False)]]

        Cannot convert masked element to a Python long.Coming soon: setting the mask per records!fromfile() not yet implemented for a MaskedArray.dedentMaskedIterator.__iter__common_fill_value_MaskedUnaryOperation.__call__
        Return the array minimum along the specified axis.

        .. deprecated:: 1.13.0
           This function is identical to both:

            * ``self.min(keepdims=True, axis=axis).squeeze(axis=axis)``
            * ``np.ma.minimum.reduce(self, axis=axis)``

           Typically though, ``self.min(axis=axis)`` is sufficient.

        Parameters
        ----------
        axis : int, optional
            The axis along which to find the minima. Default is None, in which case
            the minimum value in the whole array is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        min : scalar or MaskedArray
            If `axis` is None, the result is a scalar. Otherwise, if `axis` is
            given and the array is at least 2-D, the result is a masked array with
            dimension one smaller than the array on which `mini` is called.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> x = np.ma.array(np.arange(6), mask=[0 ,1, 0, 0, 0 ,1]).reshape(3, 2)
        >>> print(x)
        [[0 --]
         [2 3]
         [4 --]]
        >>> x.mini()
        0
        >>> x.mini(axis=0)
        masked_array(data = [0 3],
                     mask = [False False],
               fill_value = 999999)
        >>> print(x.mini(axis=1))
        [0 2 4]

        There is a small difference between `mini` and `min`:

        >>> x[:,1].mini(axis=0)
        masked_array(data = --,
                     mask = True,
               fill_value = 999999)
        >>> x[:,1].min(axis=0)
        masked
        MaskedArray.get_imag
        Display the string to print for masked values.

        
    Define binary operations that have a domain, like divide.

    They have no reduce, outer or accumulate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mbfunc : function
        The function for which to define a masked version. Made available
        as ``_DomainedBinaryOperation.f``.
    domain : class instance
        Default domain for the function. Should be one of the ``_Domain*``
        classes.
    fillx : scalar, optional
        Filling value for the first argument, default is 0.
    filly : scalar, optional
        Filling value for the second argument, default is 0.

    __set__MaskedConstant.__str__
    Returns element-wise base array raised to power from second array.

    This is the masked array version of `numpy.power`. For details see
    `numpy.power`.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.power

    Notes
    -----
    The *out* argument to `numpy.power` is not supported, `third` has to be
    None.

    cdtypecurdata
    Mask an array where equal to a given value.

    This function is a shortcut to ``masked_where``, with
    `condition` = (x == value).  For floating point arrays,
    consider using ``masked_values(x, value)``.

    See Also
    --------
    masked_where : Mask where a condition is met.
    masked_values : Mask using floating point equality.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma
    >>> a = np.arange(4)
    >>> a
    array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> ma.masked_equal(a, 2)

          mask = [False False  True False],
          fill_value=999999)

    
        Special hook for ufuncs.

        Wraps the numpy array and sets the mask according to context.

        
    Adds a Notes section to an existing docstring.

    MaskedArray.tobytes
    Returns the inner product of a and b for arrays of floating point types.

    Like the generic NumPy equivalent the product sum is over the last dimension
    of a and b. The first argument is not conjugated.

    
    Return the common filling value of two masked arrays, if any.

    If ``a.fill_value == b.fill_value``, return the fill value,
    otherwise return None.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : MaskedArray
        The masked arrays for which to compare fill values.

    Returns
    -------
    fill_value : scalar or None
        The common fill value, or None.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.ma.array([0, 1.], fill_value=3)
    >>> y = np.ma.array([0, 1.], fill_value=3)
    >>> np.ma.common_fill_value(x, y)

    Flexible 'hard' masks are not yet supported._DomainTan.__init__
        Set the mask.

        Return the function applied to the outer product of a and b._DomainCheckInterval.__call__propagate_mask
    Load a pickle from the current string.

    The result of ``cPickle.loads(strg)`` is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    strg : str
        The string to load.

    See Also
    --------
    dumps : Return a string corresponding to the pickling of a masked array.

    
        Return the cumulative sum of the array elements over the given axis.

        Masked values are set to 0 internally during the computation.
        However, their position is saved, and the result will be masked at
        the same locations.

        Refer to `numpy.cumsum` for full documentation.

        Notes
        -----
        The mask is lost if `out` is not a valid :class:`MaskedArray` !

        Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is
        raised on overflow.

        >>> print(marr.cumsum())
        [0 1 3 -- -- -- 9 16 24 33]

        
        Returns array of indices of the maximum values along the given axis.
        Masked values are treated as if they had the value fill_value.

        Parameters
        ----------

        If the array has no mask, the address of `nomask` is returned. This address
        is typically not close to the data in memory:

        >>> x = np.ma.array([1, 2, 3])

%sufunc_domainIn the future the default for argsort will be axis=-1, not the current None, to match its documentation and np.argsort. Explicitly pass -1 or None to silence this warning.
        Return the cumulative product of the array elements over the given axis.

        Masked values are set to 1 internally during the computation.
        However, their position is saved, and the result will be masked at
        the same locations.

        Refer to `numpy.cumprod` for full documentation.

        Notes
        -----
        The mask is lost if `out` is not a valid MaskedArray !

    DomainGreater(v)(x) is True where x <= v.

    
    Mask using floating point equality.

    Return a MaskedArray, masked where the data in array `x` are approximately
    equal to `value`, determined using `isclose`. The default tolerances for
    `masked_values` are the same as those for `isclose`.

    For integer types, exact equality is used, in the same way as
    `masked_equal`.

    The fill_value is set to `value` and the mask is set to ``nomask`` if
    possible.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Array to mask.
    value : float
        Masking value.
    rtol, atol : float, optional
        Tolerance parameters passed on to `isclose`
    copy : bool, optional
        Whether to return a copy of `x`.
    shrink : bool, optional
        Whether to collapse a mask full of False to ``nomask``.

    Returns
    -------
    result : MaskedArray
        The result of masking `x` where approximately equal to `value`.

    See Also
    --------
    masked_where : Mask where a condition is met.
    masked_equal : Mask where equal to a given value (integers).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma
    >>> x = np.array([1, 1.1, 2, 1.1, 3])
    >>> ma.masked_values(x, 1.1)
    masked_array(data = [1.0 -- 2.0 -- 3.0],
          mask = [False  True False  True False],
          fill_value=1.1)

    Note that `mask` is set to ``nomask`` if possible.

    >>> ma.masked_values(x, 1.5)
    masked_array(data = [ 1.   1.1  2.   1.1  3. ],
          mask = False,
          fill_value=1.5)

    For integers, the fill value will be different in general to the
    result of ``masked_equal``.

    >>> x = np.arange(5)
    >>> x
    array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> ma.masked_values(x, 2)
    masked_array(data = [0 1 -- 3 4],

        Return the filling value of the masked array.

        Returns
        -------
        fill_value : scalar

        --------
        >>> for dt in [np.int32, np.int64, np.float64, np.complex128]:
        ...     np.ma.array([0, 1], dtype=dt).get_fill_value()

          mask = [False False  True  True False False],
          fill_value=1e+20)

    The order of `v1` and `v2` doesn't matter.

    >>> ma.masked_inside(x, 0.3, -0.3)
    masked_array(data = [0.31 1.2 -- -- -0.4 -1.1],

    >>> import numpy.ma as ma
    >>> a = np.arange(4)
    >>> a
    array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> ma.masked_less(a, 2)
    masked_array(data = [-- -- 2 3],

          fill_value=999999)

    Cannot convert masked element to a Python int.tclassMaskedArray.partitionvaldata_print_width_1d
    Return a boolean mask of the given shape, filled with False.

    This function returns a boolean ndarray with all entries False, that can
    be used in common mask manipulations. If a complex dtype is specified, the
    type of each field is converted to a boolean type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    newshape : tuple
        A tuple indicating the shape of the mask.
    dtype : {None, dtype}, optional
        If None, use a MaskType instance. Otherwise, use a new datatype with
        the same fields as `dtype`, converted to boolean types.

    Returns
    -------
    result : ndarray
        An ndarray of appropriate shape and dtype, filled with False.

    See Also
    --------
    make_mask : Create a boolean mask from an array.
    make_mask_descr : Construct a dtype description list from a given dtype.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma
    >>> ma.make_mask_none((3,))
    array([False, False, False])

    Defining a more complex dtype.

    >>> dtype = np.dtype({'names':['foo', 'bar'],
                          'formats':[np.float32, int]})
    >>> dtype
    dtype([('foo', '<f4'), ('bar', '<i4')])
    >>> ma.make_mask_none((3,), dtype=dtype)
    array([(False, False), (False, False), (False, False)],
          dtype=[('foo', '|b1'), ('bar', '|b1')])

    
        Return a copy of self, with masked values filled with a given value.
        **However**, if there are no masked values to fill, self will be
        returned instead as an ndarray.

        Parameters
        ----------
        fill_value : scalar, optional
            The value to use for invalid entries (None by default).
            If None, the `fill_value` attribute of the array is used instead.

        Returns
        -------
        filled_array : ndarray
            A copy of ``self`` with invalid entries replaced by *fill_value*
            (be it the function argument or the attribute of ``self``), or
            ``self`` itself as an ndarray if there are no invalid entries to
            be replaced.

        Notes
        -----
        The result is **not** a MaskedArray!

        Examples
        --------
        >>> x = np.ma.array([1,2,3,4,5], mask=[0,0,1,0,1], fill_value=-999)
        >>> x.filled()
        array([1, 2, -999, 4, -999])
        >>> type(x.filled())
        <type 'numpy.ndarray'>

        Subclassing is preserved. This means that if, e.g., the data part of
        the masked array is a recarray, `filled` returns a recarray:

        >>> x = np.array([(-1, 2), (-3, 4)], dtype='i8,i8').view(np.recarray)
        >>> m = np.ma.array(x, mask=[(True, False), (False, True)])
        >>> m.filled()
        rec.array([(999999,      2), (    -3, 999999)],
                  dtype=[('f0', '<i8'), ('f1', '<i8')])
        
    Cross-correlation of two 1-dimensional sequences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, v : array_like
        Input sequences.
    mode : {'valid', 'same', 'full'}, optional
        Refer to the `np.convolve` docstring.  Note that the default
        is 'valid', unlike `convolve`, which uses 'full'.
    propagate_mask : bool
        If True, then a result element is masked if any masked element contributes towards it.
        If False, then a result element is only masked if no non-masked element
        contribute towards it

    Returns
    -------
    out : MaskedArray
        Discrete cross-correlation of `a` and `v`.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.correlate : Equivalent function in the top-level NumPy module.
    MaskedArray.__array_finalize__
        Return the indices of unmasked elements that are not zero.

        Returns a tuple of arrays, one for each dimension, containing the
        indices of the non-zero elements in that dimension. The corresponding
        non-zero values can be obtained with::

            a[a.nonzero()]

        To group the indices by element, rather than dimension, use
        instead::

            np.transpose(a.nonzero())

        The result of this is always a 2d array, with a row for each non-zero
        element.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None

        Returns
        -------
        tuple_of_arrays : tuple
            Indices of elements that are non-zero.

        See Also
        --------

            Function operating on ndarrays.
        flatnonzero :
            Return indices that are non-zero in the flattened version of the input
            array.
        ndarray.nonzero :
            Equivalent ndarray method.
        count_nonzero :
            Counts the number of non-zero elements in the input array.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> import numpy.ma as ma
        >>> x = ma.array(np.eye(3))
        >>> x
        masked_array(data =
         [[ 1.  0.  0.]
         [ 0.  1.  0.]
         [ 0.  0.  1.]],
              mask =
         False,
              fill_value=1e+20)
        >>> x.nonzero()
        (array([0, 1, 2]), array([0, 1, 2]))

        Masked elements are ignored.

        >>> x[1, 1] = ma.masked
        >>> x
        masked_array(data =
         [[1.0 0.0 0.0]
         [0.0 -- 0.0]
         [0.0 0.0 1.0]],
              mask =
         [[False False False]
         [False  True False]
         [False False False]],
              fill_value=1e+20)
        >>> x.nonzero()
        (array([0, 2]), array([0, 2]))

        Indices can also be grouped by element.

        >>> np.transpose(x.nonzero())
        array([[0, 0],
               [2, 2]])

        A common use for ``nonzero`` is to find the indices of an array, where
        a condition is True.  Given an array `a`, the condition `a` > 3 is a
        boolean array and since False is interpreted as 0, ma.nonzero(a > 3)
        yields the indices of the `a` where the condition is true.

        >>> a = ma.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
        >>> a > 3
        masked_array(data =
         [[False False False]
         [ True  True  True]
         [ True  True  True]],
              mask =
         False,
              fill_value=999999)
        >>> ma.nonzero(a > 3)
        (array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]))

        The ``nonzero`` method of the condition array can also be called.

        >>> (a > 3).nonzero()
        (array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]))

            This method does nothing, except raise a ValueError exception. A

        MaskedArray._set_recordmaskMaskedArray.var
        Force the mask to hard.

        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Parameters
        ----------
        b : masked_array_like
            Inputs array.
        out : masked_array, optional
            Output argument. This must have the exact kind that would be
            returned if it was not used. In particular, it must have the
            right type, must be C-contiguous, and its dtype must be the
            dtype that would be returned for `ma.dot(a,b)`. This is a
            performance feature. Therefore, if these conditions are not
            met, an exception is raised, instead of attempting to be
            flexible.
        strict : bool, optional
            Whether masked data are propagated (True) or set to 0 (False)
            for the computation. Default is False.  Propagating the mask
            means that if a masked value appears in a row or column, the
            whole row or column is considered masked.

    Use an index array to construct a new array from a set of choices.

    Given an array of integers and a set of n choice arrays, this method
    will create a new array that merges each of the choice arrays.  Where a
    value in `a` is i, the new array will have the value that choices[i]
    contains in the same place.

    Parameters

        This array must contain integers in ``[0, n-1]``, where n is the
        number of choices.
    choices : sequence of arrays
        Choice arrays. The index array and all of the choices should be
        broadcastable to the same shape.
    out : array, optional
        If provided, the result will be inserted into this array. It should
        be of the appropriate shape and `dtype`.
    mode : {'raise', 'wrap', 'clip'}, optional

        -----
        The result is **not** a MaskedArray!

        Examples
        --------
        >>> x = np.ma.array(np.arange(5), mask=[0]*2 + [1]*3)
        >>> x.compressed()
        array([0, 1])
        >>> type(x.compressed())
        <type 'numpy.ndarray'>

        
    Wrapper around ``cPickle.load`` which accepts either a file-like object
    or a filename.

    Parameters
    ----------
    F : str or file
        The file or file name to load.

    See Also
    --------
    dump : Pickle an array

    Notes
    -----
    This is different from `numpy.load`, which does not use cPickle but loads
    the NumPy binary .npy format.

    MaskedConstant.__array_finalize__Set a flattened version of self to value.MaskedConstant.__array_prepare__Private function allowing recursion in _replace_dtype_fields.Reduce target along the given axis.
    Return True if m is a valid, standard mask.

    This function does not check the contents of the input, only that the
    type is MaskType. In particular, this function returns False if the
    mask has a flexible dtype.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : array_like
        Array to test.

    Returns
    -------
    result : bool
        True if `m.dtype.type` is MaskType, False otherwise.

    See Also
    --------
    isMaskedArray : Test whether input is an instance of MaskedArray.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma
    >>> m = ma.masked_equal([0, 1, 0, 2, 3], 0)
    >>> m
    masked_array(data = [-- 1 -- 2 3],
          mask = [ True False  True False False],
          fill_value=999999)
    >>> ma.is_mask(m)
    False
    >>> ma.is_mask(m.mask)
    True

    Input must be an ndarray (or have similar attributes)
    for it to be considered a valid mask.

    >>> m = [False, True, False]
    >>> ma.is_mask(m)
    False
    >>> m = np.array([False, True, False])
    >>> m
    array([False,  True, False])
    >>> ma.is_mask(m)
    True

    Arrays with complex dtypes don't return True.

    >>> dtype = np.dtype({'names':['monty', 'pithon'],
                          'formats':[bool, bool]})
    >>> dtype
    dtype([('monty', '|b1'), ('pithon', '|b1')])
    >>> m = np.array([(True, False), (False, True), (True, False)],
                     dtype=dtype)
    >>> m
    array([(True, False), (False, True), (True, False)],
          dtype=[('monty', '|b1'), ('pithon', '|b1')])
    >>> ma.is_mask(m)
    False

    Return the current mask.

        Class of the underlying data (read-only).
    Return the filling value of a, if any.  Otherwise, returns the
    default filling value for that type.

    masked_{}(
    Mask rows and/or columns of a 2D array that contain masked values.

    Mask whole rows and/or columns of a 2D array that contain
    masked values.  The masking behavior is selected using the
    `axis` parameter.

      - If `axis` is None, rows *and* columns are masked.
      - If `axis` is 0, only rows are masked.
      - If `axis` is 1 or -1, only columns are masked.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like, MaskedArray
        The array to mask.  If not a MaskedArray instance (or if no array
        elements are masked).  The result is a MaskedArray with `mask` set
        to `nomask` (False). Must be a 2D array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to perform the operation. If None, applies to a
        flattened version of the array.

    Returns
    -------
    a : MaskedArray
        A modified version of the input array, masked depending on the value
        of the `axis` parameter.

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If input array `a` is not 2D.

    See Also
    --------
    mask_rows : Mask rows of a 2D array that contain masked values.
    mask_cols : Mask cols of a 2D array that contain masked values.
    masked_where : Mask where a condition is met.

    Notes
    -----
    The input array's mask is modified by this function.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma
    >>> a = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)
    >>> a[1, 1] = 1
    >>> a
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [0, 1, 0],
           [0, 0, 0]])
    >>> a = ma.masked_equal(a, 1)
    >>> a
    masked_array(data =
     [[0 0 0]
     [0 -- 0]
     [0 0 0]],
          mask =
     [[False False False]
     [False  True False]
     [False False False]],
          fill_value=999999)
    >>> ma.mask_rowcols(a)
    masked_array(data =
     [[0 -- 0]
     [-- -- --]
     [0 -- 0]],
          mask =
     [[False  True False]
     [ True  True  True]
     [False  True False]],
          fill_value=999999)

    _enabled
    Mask an array outside a given interval.

    Shortcut to ``masked_where``, where `condition` is True for `x` outside
    the interval [v1,v2] (x < v1)|(x > v2).
    The boundaries `v1` and `v2` can be given in either order.

    See Also
    --------
    masked_where : Mask where a condition is met.

    Notes
    -----
    The array `x` is prefilled with its filling value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma
    >>> x = [0.31, 1.2, 0.01, 0.2, -0.4, -1.1]
    >>> ma.masked_outside(x, -0.3, 0.3)
    masked_array(data = [-- -- 0.01 0.2 -- --],
          mask = [ True  True False False  True  True],
          fill_value=1e+20)

    The order of `v1` and `v2` doesn't matter.

    >>> ma.masked_outside(x, 0.3, -0.3)
    masked_array(data = [-- -- 0.01 0.2 -- --],
          mask = [ True  True False False  True  True],
          fill_value=1e+20)

    
    Return input as an array with masked data replaced by a fill value.

    If `a` is not a `MaskedArray`, `a` itself is returned.
    If `a` is a `MaskedArray` and `fill_value` is None, `fill_value` is set to
    ``a.fill_value``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : MaskedArray or array_like
        An input object.
    fill_value : scalar, optional
        Filling value. Default is None.

    ...                                                   [0, 0, 0]])
    >>> x.filled()

        Return `a` where condition is ``True``.

        If condition is a `MaskedArray`, missing values are considered
        as ``False``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        condition : var
            Boolean 1-d array selecting which entries to return. If len(condition)
            is less than the size of a along the axis, then output is truncated
            to length of condition array.
        axis : {None, int}, optional
            Axis along which the operation must be performed.
        out : {None, ndarray}, optional
            Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
            the same shape as the expected output but the type will be cast if
            necessary.

        Returns
        -------
        result : MaskedArray
            A :class:`MaskedArray` object.

        Notes
        -----
        Please note the difference with :meth:`compressed` !
        The output of :meth:`compress` has a mask, the output of
        :meth:`compressed` does not.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> x = np.ma.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], mask=[0] + [1,0]*4)
        >>> print(x)
        [[1 -- 3]
         [-- 5 --]
         [7 -- 9]]
        >>> x.compress([1, 0, 1])
        masked_array(data = [1 3],
              mask = [False False],
              fill_value=999999)

        >>> x.compress([1, 0, 1], axis=1)
        masked_array(data =
         [[1 3]
         [-- --]
         [7 9]],
              mask =
         [[False False]
         [ True  True]
         [False False]],
              fill_value=999999)

        _shrink_mask
        Set storage-indexed locations to corresponding values.

        Sets self._data.flat[n] = values[n] for each n in indices.
        If `values` is shorter than `indices` then it will repeat.
        If `values` has some masked values, the initial mask is updated
        in consequence, else the corresponding values are unmasked.

        Parameters
        ----------
        indices : 1-D array_like
            Target indices, interpreted as integers.
        values : array_like
            Values to place in self._data copy at target indices.
        mode : {'raise', 'wrap', 'clip'}, optional
            Specifies how out-of-bounds indices will behave.
            'raise' : raise an error.
            'wrap' : wrap around.
            'clip' : clip to the range.

        Notes
        -----
        `values` can be a scalar or length 1 array.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> x = np.ma.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], mask=[0] + [1,0]*4)
        >>> print(x)
        [[1 -- 3]
         [-- 5 --]
         [7 -- 9]]
        >>> x.put([0,4,8],[10,20,30])
        >>> print(x)
        [[10 -- 3]
         [-- 20 --]
         [7 -- 30]]

        >>> x.put(4,999)
        >>> print(x)
        [[10 -- 3]
         [-- 999 --]
         [7 -- 30]]

        Restore the internal state of the masked array, for
        pickling purposes.  ``state`` is typically the output of the
        ``__getstate__`` output, and is a 5-tuple:

        - class name
        - a tuple giving the shape of the data
        - a typecode for the data
        - a binary string for the data
        - a binary string for the mask.

        
        Return the function applied to the outer product of a and b.

        MaskedArray.argmaxMaskedArray.__floordiv__Incompatible dtypes '%s'<>'%s'_DomainGreaterEqual.__call___convert2ma.__call__
        Return each element rounded to the given number of decimals.

        Compute the anomalies (deviations from the arithmetic mean)
        along the given axis.

        Returns an array of anomalies, with the same shape as the input and
        where the arithmetic mean is computed along the given axis.

        Parameters
        ----------
        axis : int, optional
            Axis over which the anomalies are taken.
            The default is to use the mean of the flattened array as reference.
        dtype : dtype, optional
            Type to use in computing the variance. For arrays of integer type
             the default is float32; for arrays of float types it is the same as
             the array type.

        False. Defaults to True.

    Returns
    -------
    mask : output mask
        The result masks values that are masked in either `m1` or `m2`.

    Raises
    ------

    shape : tuple
        Shape of the required MaskedArray.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Data type of the output.

    Returns

    --------
    extras.compress_rowcols

    notmasked_contiguousasortedlow_highreplace_masked_median.<locals>.replace_masked
    Return Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients.

    Except for the handling of missing data this function does the same as
    `numpy.corrcoef`. For more details and examples, see `numpy.corrcoef`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        A 1-D or 2-D array containing multiple variables and observations.
        Each row of `x` represents a variable, and each column a single
        observation of all those variables. Also see `rowvar` below.
    y : array_like, optional
        An additional set of variables and observations. `y` has the same
        shape as `x`.
    rowvar : bool, optional
        If `rowvar` is True (default), then each row represents a
        variable, with observations in the columns. Otherwise, the relationship
        is transposed: each column represents a variable, while the rows
        contain observations.
    bias : _NoValue, optional
        Has no effect, do not use.

        .. deprecated:: 1.10.0
    allow_masked : bool, optional
        If True, masked values are propagated pair-wise: if a value is masked
        in `x`, the corresponding value is masked in `y`.
        If False, raises an exception.  Because `bias` is deprecated, this
        argument needs to be treated as keyword only to avoid a warning.
    ddof : _NoValue, optional
        Has no effect, do not use.

        .. deprecated:: 1.10.0

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.corrcoef : Equivalent function in top-level NumPy module.
    cov : Estimate the covariance matrix.

    Notes
    -----
    This function accepts but discards arguments `bias` and `ddof`.  This is
    for backwards compatibility with previous versions of this function.  These
    arguments had no effect on the return values of the function and can be
    safely ignored in this and previous versions of numpy.
    flag2
    Find the indices of the first and last unmasked values.

    Expects a 1-D `MaskedArray`, returns None if all values are masked.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input 1-D `MaskedArray`

    Returns
    -------
    edges : ndarray or None
        The indices of first and last non-masked value in the array.
        Returns None if all values are masked.

    See Also
    --------
    flatnotmasked_contiguous, notmasked_contiguous, notmasked_edges,
    clump_masked, clump_unmasked

    Notes
    -----
    Only accepts 1-D arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.ma.arange(10)
    >>> flatnotmasked_edges(a)
    [0,-1]

    >>> mask = (a < 3) | (a > 8) | (a == 5)
    >>> a[mask] = np.ma.masked
    >>> np.array(a[~a.mask])
    array([3, 4, 6, 7, 8])

    >>> flatnotmasked_edges(a)
    array([3, 8])

    >>> a[:] = np.ma.masked
    >>> print(flatnotmasked_edges(ma))
    None

    compress_rowsnot_m
    Return the weighted average of array over the given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Data to be averaged.
        Masked entries are not taken into account in the computation.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to average `a`. If `None`, averaging is done over
        the flattened array.
    weights : array_like, optional
        The importance that each element has in the computation of the average.
        The weights array can either be 1-D (in which case its length must be
        the size of `a` along the given axis) or of the same shape as `a`.
        If ``weights=None``, then all data in `a` are assumed to have a
        weight equal to one.   If `weights` is complex, the imaginary parts
        are ignored.
    returned : bool, optional
        Flag indicating whether a tuple ``(result, sum of weights)``
        should be returned as output (True), or just the result (False).
        Default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    average, [sum_of_weights] : (tuple of) scalar or MaskedArray
        The average along the specified axis. When returned is `True`,
        return a tuple with the average as the first element and the sum
        of the weights as the second element. The return type is `np.float64`
        if `a` is of integer type and floats smaller than `float64`, or the
        input data-type, otherwise. If returned, `sum_of_weights` is always
        `float64`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.ma.array([1., 2., 3., 4.], mask=[False, False, True, True])
    >>> np.ma.average(a, weights=[3, 1, 0, 0])
    1.25

    >>> x = np.ma.arange(6.).reshape(3, 2)
    >>> print(x)
    [[ 0.  1.]
     [ 2.  3.]
     [ 4.  5.]]
    >>> avg, sumweights = np.ma.average(x, axis=0, weights=[1, 2, 3],
    ...                                 returned=True)
    >>> print(avg)
    [2.66666666667 3.66666666667]

    
    A version of `_fromnxfunction` that is called with a single array
    argument followed by auxiliary args that are passed verbatim for
    both the data and mask calls.
    Suppress slices from multiple dimensions which contain masked values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, MaskedArray
        The array to operate on. If not a MaskedArray instance (or if no array
        elements are masked, `x` is interpreted as a MaskedArray with `mask`
        set to `nomask`.
    axis : tuple of ints or int, optional
        Which dimensions to suppress slices from can be configured with this
        parameter.
        - If axis is a tuple of ints, those are the axes to suppress slices from.
        - If axis is an int, then that is the only axis to suppress slices from.
        - If axis is None, all axis are selected.

    Returns
    -------
    compress_array : ndarray
        The compressed array.
    groupby
    Return list of slices corresponding to the unmasked clumps of a 1-D array.
    (A "clump" is defined as a contiguous region of the array).

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        A one-dimensional masked array.

    Returns
    -------
    slices : list of slice
        The list of slices, one for each continuous region of unmasked
        elements in `a`.

    See Also
    --------

    >>> a[[0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9]] = np.ma.masked
    >>> np.ma.clump_unmasked(a)
    [slice(3, 6, None), slice(7, 8, None)]

    auxf
    A version of `_fromnxfunction` that is called with multiple array
    arguments. The first non-array-like input marks the beginning of the
    arguments that are passed verbatim for both the data and mask calls.
    Array arguments are processed independently and the results are
    returned in a list. If only one array is found, the return value is
    just the processed array instead of a list.
    nxarrayxmask_fromnxfunction.getdoc
    Translate slice objects to concatenation along an axis.

    For documentation on usage, see `mr_class`.

    See Also
    --------
    mr_class

    
    Compute the median along the specified axis.

    Returns the median of the array elements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the medians are computed. The default (None) is
        to compute the median along a flattened version of the array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output
        but the type will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
        If True, then allow use of memory of input array (a) for
        calculations. The input array will be modified by the call to
        median. This will save memory when you do not need to preserve
        the contents of the input array. Treat the input as undefined,
        but it will probably be fully or partially sorted. Default is
        False. Note that, if `overwrite_input` is True, and the input
        is not already an `ndarray`, an error will be raised.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    Returns
    -------
    median : ndarray
        A new array holding the result is returned unless out is
        specified, in which case a reference to out is returned.
        Return data-type is `float64` for integers and floats smaller than
        `float64`, or the input data-type, otherwise.

    See Also
    --------
    mean

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` with ``N`` non masked values, the median of ``V``
    is the middle value of a sorted copy of ``V`` (``Vs``) - i.e.
    ``Vs[(N-1)/2]``, when ``N`` is odd, or ``{Vs[N/2 - 1] + Vs[N/2]}/2``
    when ``N`` is even.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.ma.array(np.arange(8), mask=[0]*4 + [1]*4)
    >>> np.ma.median(x)
    1.5

    >>> x = np.ma.array(np.arange(10).reshape(2, 5), mask=[0]*6 + [1]*4)
    >>> np.ma.median(x)

      [--]
      [124]]]

    Tuple axis arguments to ufuncs are equivalent:

    >>> print(ma.sum(a, axis=(0,2)).reshape((1,-1,1)))
    [[[46]
      [--]
      [124]]]
    
    Estimate the covariance matrix.

    Except for the handling of missing data this function does the same as
    `numpy.cov`. For more details and examples, see `numpy.cov`.

    By default, masked values are recognized as such. If `x` and `y` have the
    same shape, a common mask is allocated: if ``x[i,j]`` is masked, then
    ``y[i,j]`` will also be masked.
    Setting `allow_masked` to False will raise an exception if values are
    missing in either of the input arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        A 1-D or 2-D array containing multiple variables and observations.
        Each row of `x` represents a variable, and each column a single
        observation of all those variables. Also see `rowvar` below.
    y : array_like, optional
        An additional set of variables and observations. `y` has the same
        form as `x`.
    rowvar : bool, optional
        If `rowvar` is True (default), then each row represents a
        variable, with observations in the columns. Otherwise, the relationship
        is transposed: each column represents a variable, while the rows
        contain observations.
    bias : bool, optional
        Default normalization (False) is by ``(N-1)``, where ``N`` is the
        number of observations given (unbiased estimate). If `bias` is True,
        then normalization is by ``N``. This keyword can be overridden by
        the keyword ``ddof`` in numpy versions >= 1.5.
    allow_masked : bool, optional
        If True, masked values are propagated pair-wise: if a value is masked
        in `x`, the corresponding value is masked in `y`.
        If False, raises a `ValueError` exception when some values are missing.
    ddof : {None, int}, optional
        If not ``None`` normalization is by ``(N - ddof)``, where ``N`` is
        the number of observations; this overrides the value implied by
        ``bias``. The default value is ``None``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raised if some values are missing and `allow_masked` is False.

           fill_value = 999999)

    
    Private function for the computation of covariance and correlation
    coefficients.

    
    A version of `_fromnxfunction` that is called with multiple array
    arguments. Similar to `_fromnxfunction_args` except that all args
    are converted to arrays even if they are not so already. This makes
    it possible to process scalars as 1-D arrays. Only keyword arguments
    are passed through verbatim for the data and mask calls. Arrays
    arguments are processed independently and the results are returned
    in a list. If only one arg is present, the return value is just the
    processed array instead of a list.
    
    Returns a list of slices corresponding to the masked clumps of a 1-D array.
    (A "clump" is defined as a contiguous region of the array).

    Parameters
    ----------

        A one-dimensional masked array.

    Returns
    -------
    slices : list of slice
        The list of slices, one for each continuous region of masked elements
        in `a`.

    the array `arr`, where all the data are masked.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
        An array describing the shape and dtype of the required MaskedArray.

    Returns
    -------

    Suppress whole rows of a 2-D array that contain masked values.

    This is equivalent to ``np.ma.compress_rowcols(a, 0)``, see
    `extras.compress_rowcols` for details.

    See Also
    --------
    extras.compress_rowcols

    
    Defines a wrapper to adapt NumPy functions to masked arrays.


    An instance of `_fromnxfunction` can be called with the same parameters
    as the wrapped NumPy function. The docstring of `newfunc` is adapted from
    the wrapped function as well, see `getdoc`.

    This class should not be used directly. Instead, one of its extensions that
    provides support for a specific type of input should be used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    funcname : str
        The name of the function to be adapted. The function should be
        in the NumPy namespace (i.e. ``np.funcname``).

    compress_cols works for 2D arrays only.flatten_inplace
    A version of `_fromnxfunction` that is called with a single sequence
    of arrays followed by auxiliary args that are passed verbatim for
    both the data and mask calls.
    
    Any masked values in x is propagated in y, and vice-versa.

    _fromnxfunction_allargs.__call___covhelpercompress_rowcols works for 2D arrays only.
    Mask columns of a 2D array that contain masked values.

    This function is a shortcut to ``mask_rowcols`` with `axis` equal to 1.

    See Also
    --------
    mask_rowcols : Mask rows and/or columns of a 2D array.
    masked_where : Mask where a condition is met.

     [False  True False]
     [False  True False]],
          fill_value=999999)

    
    Find the indices of the first and last unmasked values along an axis.

    If all values are masked, return None.  Otherwise, return a list
    of two tuples, corresponding to the indices of the first and last
    unmasked values respectively.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The input array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to perform the operation.
        If None (default), applies to a flattened version of the array.

    Returns
    -------
    edges : ndarray or list
        An array of start and end indexes if there are any masked data in
        the array. If there are no masked data in the array, `edges` is a
        list of the first and last index.

    Suppress the rows and/or columns of a 2-D array that contain
    masked values.

    The suppression behavior is selected with the `axis` parameter.

    - If axis is None, both rows and columns are suppressed.
    - If axis is 0, only rows are suppressed.
    - If axis is 1 or -1, only columns are suppressed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, MaskedArray
        The array to operate on.  If not a MaskedArray instance (or if no array
        elements are masked), `x` is interpreted as a MaskedArray with
        `mask` set to `nomask`. Must be a 2D array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to perform the operation. Default is None.

    MaskedRecords.viewnewmdtypeAdds a new field to the masked record array

    Uses `newfield` as data and `newfieldname` as name. If `newfieldname`
    is None, the new field name is set to 'fi', where `i` is the number of
    existing fields.

    
        Returns all the fields sharing the same fieldname base.

        The fieldname base is either `_data` or `_mask`.

        
        Returns the length

        _get_fieldmask:mod:`numpy.ma..mrecords`

Defines the equivalent of :class:`numpy.recarrays` for masked arrays,
where fields can be accessed as attributes.
Note that :class:`numpy.ma.MaskedArray` already supports structured datatypes
and the masking of individual fields.

.. moduleauthor:: Pierre Gerard-Marchant


    Creates a mrecarray from a (flat) list of masked arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arraylist : sequence
        A list of (masked) arrays. Each element of the sequence is first converted
        to a masked array if needed. If a 2D array is passed as argument, it is
        processed line by line
    dtype : {None, dtype}, optional
        Data type descriptor.
    shape : {None, integer}, optional
        Number of records. If None, shape is defined from the shape of the
        first array in the list.
    formats : {None, sequence}, optional
        Sequence of formats for each individual field. If None, the formats will
        be autodetected by inspecting the fields and selecting the highest dtype
        possible.
    names : {None, sequence}, optional
        Sequence of the names of each field.
    fill_value : {None, sequence}, optional
        Sequence of data to be used as filling values.

    Notes
    -----
    Lists of tuples should be preferred over lists of lists for faster processing.

    Creates a mrecarray from data stored in the file `filename`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : {file name/handle}
        Handle of an opened file.
    delimitor : {None, string}, optional
        Alphanumeric character used to separate columns in the file.
        If None, any (group of) white spacestring(s) will be used.

        Alphanumeric character used to mark the start of a comment.
    missingchar : {'', string}, optional
        String indicating missing data, and used to create the masks.
    varnames : {None, sequence}, optional
        Sequence of the variable names. If None, a list will be created from
        the first non empty line of the file.
    vartypes : {None, sequence}, optional
        Sequence of the variables dtypes. If None, it will be estimated from
        the first non-commented line.


    Ultra simple: the varnames are in the header, one line
    Tries to guess the dtypes of the str_ ndarray `arr`.

    Guesses by testing element-wise conversion. Returns a list of dtypes.
    The array is first converted to ndarray. If the array is 2D, the test
    is performed on the first line. An exception is raised if the file is
    3D or more.

    _mrreconstruct
    Opens the file handle of file `fname`.

        /home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/ma/mrecords.py
        Returns the data as a recarray.

        MaskedRecords.soften_mask
    Creates a MaskedRecords from a list of records.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reclist : sequence
        A list of records. Each element of the sequence is first converted
        to a masked array if needed. If a 2D array is passed as argument, it is
        processed line by line
    dtype : {None, dtype}, optional
        Data type descriptor.
    shape : {None,int}, optional
        Number of records. If None, ``shape`` is defined from the shape of the
        first array in the list.
    formats : {None, sequence}, optional
        Sequence of formats for each individual field. If None, the formats will
        be autodetected by inspecting the fields and selecting the highest dtype
        possible.
    names : {None, sequence}, optional
        Sequence of the names of each field.
    fill_value : {None, sequence}, optional
        Sequence of data to be used as filling values.
    mask : {nomask, sequence}, optional.
        External mask to apply on the data.

    Notes
    -----
    Lists of tuples should be preferred over lists of lists for faster processing.

    MaskedRecords.__str__recfromarraysMaskedRecords.__setstate__
        Restore the internal state of the masked array.

        This is for pickling.  ``state`` is typically the output of the
        ``__getstate__`` output, and is a 5-tuple:

        - class name
        - a tuple giving the shape of the data
        - a typecode for the data
        - a binary string for the data
        - a binary string for the mask.

                      )
        Returns a view of the mrecarray.

        MaskedRecords.__setattr__
    Checks that field names ``descr`` are not reserved keywords.

    If this is the case, a default 'f%i' is substituted.  If the argument
    `names` is not None, updates the field names to valid names.

    MaskedRecords._getfieldmaskMaskedRecords.__reduce__
        Forces the mask to hard.

        
        Return the data portion of the array as a list.

        Data items are converted to the nearest compatible Python type.
        Masked values are converted to fill_value. If fill_value is None,
        the corresponding entries in the output list will be ``None``.

        
        Calculates the repr representation.

        MaskedRecords.__getstate__MaskedRecords.__array_finalize__Sub-package containing the matrix class and related functions.

/home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/matrixlib/__init__.py<module numpy.matrixlib>A convenience function for operations that need to preserve axis
        orientation.
        matrix.__new__matrix.getA1<module numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix>matrix.squeeze
    matrix(data, dtype=None, copy=True)

    .. note:: It is no longer recommended to use this class, even for linear
              algebra. Instead use regular arrays. The class may be removed
              in the future.

    Returns a matrix from an array-like object, or from a string of data.
    A matrix is a specialized 2-D array that retains its 2-D nature
    through operations.  It has certain special operators, such as ``*``
    (matrix multiplication) and ``**`` (matrix power).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array_like or string
       If `data` is a string, it is interpreted as a matrix with commas
       or spaces separating columns, and semicolons separating rows.
    dtype : data-type
       Data-type of the output matrix.
    copy : bool
       If `data` is already an `ndarray`, then this flag determines
       whether the data is copied (the default), or whether a view is
       constructed.

    See Also
    --------
    array

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.matrix('1 2; 3 4')
    >>> print(a)
    [[1 2]
     [3 4]]

    >>> np.matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    matrix([[1, 2],
            [3, 4]])

    matrix.__rmul__matrix.__getitem__getT
        Return a flattened matrix.

        Refer to `numpy.ravel` for more documentation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
            The elements of `m` are read using this index order. 'C' means to
            index the elements in C-like order, with the last axis index
            changing fastest, back to the first axis index changing slowest.
            'F' means to index the elements in Fortran-like index order, with
            the first index changing fastest, and the last index changing
            slowest. Note that the 'C' and 'F' options take no account of the
            memory layout of the underlying array, and only refer to the order
            of axis indexing.  'A' means to read the elements in Fortran-like
            index order if `m` is Fortran *contiguous* in memory, C-like order
            otherwise.  'K' means to read the elements in the order they occur
            in memory, except for reversing the data when strides are negative.
            By default, 'C' index order is used.

        Returns
        -------
        ret : matrix
            Return the matrix flattened to shape `(1, N)` where `N`
            is the number of elements in the original matrix.
            A copy is made only if necessary.

        See Also
        --------
        numpy.std

        Notes
        -----

        matrix.getI
        Return a flattened copy of the matrix.

        All `N` elements of the matrix are placed into a single row.

        Parameters
        ----------
        order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
            'C' means to flatten in row-major (C-style) order. 'F' means to
            flatten in column-major (Fortran-style) order. 'A' means to
            flatten in column-major order if `m` is Fortran *contiguous* in
            memory, row-major order otherwise. 'K' means to flatten `m` in

        coltupmatrix.__mul__
    Interpret the input as a matrix.

    Unlike `matrix`, `asmatrix` does not make a copy if the input is already
    a matrix or an ndarray.  Equivalent to ``matrix(data, copy=False)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array_like
        Input data.
    dtype : data-type
       Data-type of the output matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    mat : matrix
        `data` interpreted as a matrix.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

    >>> m = np.asmatrix(x)

    >>> x[0,0] = 5

    >>> m
    matrix([[5, 2],
            [3, 4]])

    A convenience function for operations that want to collapse
        to a scalar like _align, but are using keepdims=True
        
        Returns the transpose of the matrix.

        Does *not* conjugate!  For the complex conjugate transpose, use ``.H``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None

        Returns
        -------
        ret : matrix object

        >>> m = np.matrix('[1, 2; 3, 4]')
        >>> m
        matrix([[1, 2],
                [3, 4]])
        >>> m.getT()
        matrix([[1, 3],
                [2, 4]])

        matrix.argmaxmatrix.argminRows not the same size.
        Return a possibly reshaped matrix.

        Refer to `numpy.squeeze` for more documentation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
            Selects a subset of the single-dimensional entries in the shape.
            If an axis is selected with shape entry greater than one,
            an error is raised.

        Returns
        -------
        squeezed : matrix
            The matrix, but as a (1, N) matrix if it had shape (N, 1).

        See Also
        --------
        numpy.squeeze : related function

        Notes
        -----
        If `m` has a single column then that column is returned
        as the single row of a matrix.  Otherwise `m` is returned.
        The returned matrix is always either `m` itself or a view into `m`.
        Supplying an axis keyword argument will not affect the returned matrix
        but it may cause an error to be raised.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> c = np.matrix([[1], [2]])

        unsupported axismatrix.__imul__/home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/polynomial/__init__.py<module numpy.polynomial>laguerrelegendrechebyshevhermitehermite_e
A sub-package for efficiently dealing with polynomials.

Within the documentation for this sub-package, a "finite power series,"
i.e., a polynomial (also referred to simply as a "series") is represented
by a 1-D numpy array of the polynomial's coefficients, ordered from lowest
order term to highest.  For example, array([1,2,3]) represents
``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``, where P_n is the n-th order basis polynomial
applicable to the specific module in question, e.g., `polynomial` (which
"wraps" the "standard" basis) or `chebyshev`.  For optimal performance,
all operations on polynomials, including evaluation at an argument, are
implemented as operations on the coefficients.  Additional (module-specific)
information can be found in the docstring for the module of interest.

Subclasses must define either a basis name, or override _repr_latex_term(i, arg_str, needs_parens) + {}ABCPolyBase.basisABCPolyBase.__str__ABCPolyBase._fromrootsABCPolyBase._rootsABCPolyBase._subABCPolyBase.__floordiv__Polynomial types differCheck if coefficients match.

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

        Parameters
        ----------
        other : class instance
            The other class must have the ``coef`` attribute.

        Returns
        -------
        bool : boolean
            True if the coefficients are the same, False otherwise.

        $x \mapsto {}$ABCPolyBase.__call__ABCPolyBase.__mul__Interpret other as polynomial coefficients.

        The `other` argument is checked to see if it is of the same
        class as self with identical domain and window. If so,
        return its coefficients, otherwise return `other`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

        Parameters
        ----------
        other : anything
            Object to be checked.

        Returns
        -------
        coef
            The coefficients of`other` if it is a compatible instance,
            of ABCPolyBase, otherwise `other`.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            When `other` is an incompatible instance of ABCPolyBase.

        Windows differ - {}ABCPolyBase.__pos__Return the mapping parameters.

        The returned values define a linear map ``off + scl*x`` that is
        applied to the input arguments before the series is evaluated. The
        map depends on the ``domain`` and ``window``; if the current
        ``domain`` is equal to the ``window`` the resulting map is the
        identity.  If the coefficients of the series instance are to be
        used by themselves outside this class, then the linear function
        must be substituted for the ``x`` in the standard representation of
        the base polynomials.

        Returns
        -------
        off, scl : float or complex
            The mapping function is defined by ``off + scl*x``.

        Notes
        -----
        If the current domain is the interval ``[l1, r1]`` and the window
        is ``[l2, r2]``, then the linear mapping function ``L`` is
        defined by the equations::

            L(l1) = l2
            L(r1) = r2

        ABCPolyBase._intothercoefABCPolyBase._mulABCPolyBase._valABCPolyBase.__divmod__Return x, y values at equally spaced points in domain.

        Returns the x, y values at `n` linearly spaced points across the
        domain.  Here y is the value of the polynomial at the points x. By
        default the domain is the same as that of the series instance.
        This method is intended mostly as a plotting aid.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int, optional
            Number of point pairs to return. The default value is 100.
        domain : {None, array_like}, optional
            If not None, the specified domain is used instead of that of
            the calling instance. It should be of the form ``[beg,end]``.
            The default is None which case the class domain is used.

        Returns
        -------
        x, y : ndarray
            x is equal to linspace(self.domain[0], self.domain[1], n) and
            y is the series evaluated at element of x.

        ABCPolyBase.cutdegABCPolyBase.fromrootsABCPolyBase._powABCPolyBase.mapparmsConvert series to a different kind and/or domain and/or window.

        Parameters
        ----------
        domain : array_like, optional
            The domain of the converted series. If the value is None,
            the default domain of `kind` is used.
        kind : class, optional
            The polynomial series type class to which the current instance
            should be converted. If kind is None, then the class of the
            current instance is used.
        window : array_like, optional
            The window of the converted series. If the value is None,
            the default window of `kind` is used.

        Returns
        -------
        new_series : series
            The returned class can be of different type than the current
            instance and/or have a different domain and/or different
            window.

        Notes
        -----
        Conversion between domains and class types can result in
        numerically ill defined series.

        Examples
        --------

        ABCPolyBase._lineABCPolyBase.__pow__ABCPolyBase.identityABCPolyBase.__sub__Least squares fit to data.

        Return a series instance that is the least squares fit to the data
        `y` sampled at `x`. The domain of the returned instance can be
        specified and this will often result in a superior fit with less
        chance of ill conditioning.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : array_like, shape (M,)
            x-coordinates of the M sample points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
        y : array_like, shape (M,) or (M, K)
            y-coordinates of the sample points. Several data sets of sample
            points sharing the same x-coordinates can be fitted at once by
            passing in a 2D-array that contains one dataset per column.
        deg : int or 1-D array_like
            Degree(s) of the fitting polynomials. If `deg` is a single integer
            all terms up to and including the `deg`'th term are included in the
            fit. For NumPy versions >= 1.11.0 a list of integers specifying the
            degrees of the terms to include may be used instead.
        domain : {None, [beg, end], []}, optional
            Domain to use for the returned series. If ``None``,
            then a minimal domain that covers the points `x` is chosen.  If
            ``[]`` the class domain is used. The default value was the
            class domain in NumPy 1.4 and ``None`` in later versions.
            The ``[]`` option was added in numpy 1.5.0.
        rcond : float, optional
            Relative condition number of the fit. Singular values smaller
            than this relative to the largest singular value will be
            ignored. The default value is len(x)*eps, where eps is the
            relative precision of the float type, about 2e-16 in most
            cases.
        full : bool, optional
            Switch determining nature of return value. When it is False
            (the default) just the coefficients are returned, when True
            diagnostic information from the singular value decomposition is
            also returned.
        w : array_like, shape (M,), optional
            Weights. If not None the contribution of each point
            ``(x[i],y[i])`` to the fit is weighted by `w[i]`. Ideally the
            weights are chosen so that the errors of the products
            ``w[i]*y[i]`` all have the same variance.  The default value is
            None.

            .. versionadded:: 1.5.0
        window : {[beg, end]}, optional
            Window to use for the returned series. The default
            value is the default class domain

            .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

        Returns
        -------
        new_series : series
            A series that represents the least squares fit to the data and
            has the domain and window specified in the call. If the
            coefficients for the unscaled and unshifted basis polynomials are
            of interest, do ``new_series.convert().coef``.

        [resid, rank, sv, rcond] : list
            These values are only returned if `full` = True

            resid -- sum of squared residuals of the least squares fit
            rank -- the numerical rank of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
            sv -- singular values of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
            rcond -- value of `rcond`.

            For more details, see `linalg.lstsq`.

        ABCPolyBase.__div__\color{{LightGray}}{{{}}}\text{{{}}}Identity function.

        If ``p`` is the returned series, then ``p(x) == x`` for all
        values of x.

        Parameters
        ----------
        domain : {None, array_like}, optional
            If given, the array must be of the form ``[beg, end]``, where
            ``beg`` and ``end`` are the endpoints of the domain. If None is
            given then the class domain is used. The default is None.
        window : {None, array_like}, optional
            If given, the resulting array must be if the form
            ``[beg, end]``, where ``beg`` and ``end`` are the endpoints of
            the window. If None is given then the class window is used. The
            default is None.

        Returns
        -------
        new_series : series
             Series of representing the identity.

        ABCPolyBase.__repr___get_coefficientsABCPolyBase.rootsABCPolyBase.has_samedomain{}\,{}has_sametypeABCPolyBase.integDomains differABCPolyBase.__radd__Truncate series to length `size`.

        Reduce the series to length `size` by discarding the high
        degree terms. The value of `size` must be a positive integer. This
        can be useful in least squares where the coefficients of the
        high degree terms may be very small.

        Parameters
        ----------
        size : positive int
            The series is reduced to length `size` by discarding the high
            degree terms. The value of `size` must be a positive integer.

        Returns
        -------
        new_series : series
            New instance of series with truncated coefficients.

Abstract base class for the various polynomial Classes.

The ABCPolyBase class provides the methods needed to implement the common API
for the various polynomial classes. It operates as a mixin, but uses the

        squares where the coefficients of the high degree terms may be very
        small.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

        Parameters
        ----------
        deg : non-negative int
            The series is reduced to degree `deg` by discarding the high
            order terms. The value of `deg` must be a non-negative integer.

        chebpts1
    Divide one Chebyshev series by another.

    Returns the quotient-with-remainder of two Chebyshev series
    `c1` / `c2`.  The arguments are sequences of coefficients from lowest
    order "term" to highest, e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series
    ``T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    [quo, rem] : ndarrays
        Of Chebyshev series coefficients representing the quotient and
        remainder.

    See Also
    --------
    chebadd, chebsub, chemulx, chebmul, chebpow

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the (polynomial) division of one C-series by another
    results in quotient and remainder terms that are not in the Chebyshev
    polynomial basis set.  Thus, to express these results as C-series, it
    is typically necessary to "reproject" the results onto said basis
    set, which typically produces "unintuitive" (but correct) results;
    see Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import chebyshev as C
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> C.chebdiv(c1,c2) # quotient "intuitive," remainder not
    (array([ 3.]), array([-8., -4.]))
    >>> c2 = (0,1,2,3)
    >>> C.chebdiv(c2,c1) # neither "intuitive"
    (array([ 0.,  2.]), array([-2., -4.]))

    nptschebdomain
    Evaluate a 2-D Chebyshev series on the Cartesian product of x and y.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b) = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * T_i(a) * T_j(b),

    where the points `(a, b)` consist of all pairs formed by taking
    `a` from `x` and `b` from `y`. The resulting points form a grid with
    `x` in the first dimension and `y` in the second.

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In either
    case, either `x` and `y` or their elements must support multiplication
    and addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than two dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 2-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[2:] +
    x.shape + y.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like, compatible objects
        The two dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x` and `y`.  If `x` or `y` is a list or
        tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is left
        unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term of
        multi-degree i,j is contained in `c[i,j]`. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional Chebyshev series at points in the
        Cartesian product of `x` and `y`.

    Subtract one Chebyshev series from another.

    Returns the difference of two Chebyshev series `c1` - `c2`.  The
    sequences of coefficients are from lowest order term to highest, i.e.,
    [1,2,3] represents the series ``T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Of Chebyshev series coefficients representing their difference.

    See Also
    --------
    chebadd, chebmulx, chebmul, chebdiv, chebpow

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the difference of two Chebyshev
    series is a Chebyshev series (without having to "reproject" the result
    onto the basis set) so subtraction, just like that of "standard"
    polynomials, is simply "component-wise."

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import chebyshev as C
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> C.chebsub(c1,c2)
    array([-2.,  0.,  2.])
    >>> C.chebsub(c2,c1) # -C.chebsub(c1,c2)
    array([ 2.,  0., -2.])

    Divide the first z-series by the second.

    Divide `z1` by `z2` and return the quotient and remainder as z-series.
    Warning: this implementation only applies when both z1 and z2 have the
    same symmetry, which is sufficient for present purposes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    z1, z2 : 1-D ndarray
        The arrays must be 1-D and have the same symmetry, but this is not
        checked.

    Returns
    -------

    (quotient, remainder) : 1-D ndarrays
        Quotient and remainder as z-series.

    Notes
    -----
    This is not the same as polynomial division on account of the desired form
    of the remainder. If symmetric/anti-symmetric z-series are denoted by S/A
    then the following rules apply:

    S/S -> S,S
    A/A -> S,A

    The restriction to types of the same symmetry could be fixed but seems like
    unneeded generality. There is no natural form for the remainder in the case
    where there is no symmetry.

    Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degrees.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degrees `deg` and sample
    points `(x, y)`. The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., (deg[1] + 1)*i + j] = T_i(x) * T_j(y),

    where `0 <= i <= deg[0]` and `0 <= j <= deg[1]`. The leading indices of
    `V` index the points `(x, y)` and the last index encodes the degrees of
    the Chebyshev polynomials.

    If ``V = chebvander2d(x, y, [xdeg, ydeg])``, then the columns of `V`
    correspond to the elements of a 2-D coefficient array `c` of shape
    (xdeg + 1, ydeg + 1) in the order

    .. math:: c_{00}, c_{01}, c_{02} ... , c_{10}, c_{11}, c_{12} ...

    and ``np.dot(V, c.flat)`` and ``chebval2d(x, y, c)`` will be the same
    up to roundoff. This equivalence is useful both for least squares
    fitting and for the evaluation of a large number of 2-D Chebyshev
    series of the same degrees and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        Arrays of point coordinates, all of the same shape. The dtypes
        will be converted to either float64 or complex128 depending on
        whether any of the elements are complex. Scalars are converted to
        1-D arrays.
    deg : list of ints
        List of maximum degrees of the form [x_deg, y_deg].

    Returns
    -------
    vander2d : ndarray
        The shape of the returned matrix is ``x.shape + (order,)``, where
        :math:`order = (deg[0]+1)*(deg([1]+1)`.  The dtype will be the same
        as the converted `x` and `y`.

    chebgrid2dchebtrimInterpolate a function at the Chebyshev points of the first kind.

    Returns the Chebyshev series that interpolates `func` at the Chebyshev
    points of the first kind in the interval [-1, 1]. The interpolating
    series tends to a minmax approximation to `func` with increasing `deg`
    if the function is continuous in the interval.

    .. versionadded:: 1.14.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : function
        The function to be approximated. It must be a function of a single
        variable of the form ``f(x, a, b, c...)``, where ``a, b, c...`` are
        extra arguments passed in the `args` parameter.
    deg : int
        Degree of the interpolating polynomial
    args : tuple, optional
        Extra arguments to be used in the function call. Default is no extra
        arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray, shape (deg + 1,)
        Chebyshev coefficients of the interpolating series ordered from low to
        high.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.polynomial.chebyshev as C
    >>> C.chebfromfunction(lambda x: np.tanh(x) + 0.5, 8)
    array([  5.00000000e-01,   8.11675684e-01,  -9.86864911e-17,
            -5.42457905e-02,  -2.71387850e-16,   4.51658839e-03,
             2.46716228e-17,  -3.79694221e-04,  -3.26899002e-16])

    Notes
    -----

    The Chebyshev polynomials used in the interpolation are orthogonal when
    sampled at the Chebyshev points of the first kind. If it is desired to
    constrain some of the coefficients they can simply be set to the desired
    value after the interpolation, no new interpolation or fit is needed. This
    is especially useful if it is known apriori that some of coefficients are
    zero. For instance, if the function is even then the coefficients of the
    terms of odd degree in the result can be set to zero.

    npts must be >= 2chebgauss
    Integrate a Chebyshev series.

    Returns the Chebyshev series coefficients `c` integrated `m` times from
    `lbnd` along `axis`. At each iteration the resulting series is
    **multiplied** by `scl` and an integration constant, `k`, is added.
    The scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable.  ("Buyer
    beware": note that, depending on what one is doing, one may want `scl`
    to be the reciprocal of what one might expect; for more information,
    see the Notes section below.)  The argument `c` is an array of
    coefficients from low to high degree along each axis, e.g., [1,2,3]
    represents the series ``T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2`` while [[1,2],[1,2]]
    represents ``1*T_0(x)*T_0(y) + 1*T_1(x)*T_0(y) + 2*T_0(x)*T_1(y) +
    2*T_1(x)*T_1(y)`` if axis=0 is ``x`` and axis=1 is ``y``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        Array of Chebyshev series coefficients. If c is multidimensional
        the different axis correspond to different variables with the
        degree in each axis given by the corresponding index.
    m : int, optional
        Order of integration, must be positive. (Default: 1)
    k : {[], list, scalar}, optional
        Integration constant(s).  The value of the first integral at zero
        is the first value in the list, the value of the second integral
        at zero is the second value, etc.  If ``k == []`` (the default),
        all constants are set to zero.  If ``m == 1``, a single scalar can
        be given instead of a list.
    lbnd : scalar, optional
        The lower bound of the integral. (Default: 0)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Following each integration the result is *multiplied* by `scl`
        before the integration constant is added. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the integral is taken. (Default: 0).

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    S : ndarray
        C-series coefficients of the integral.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``m < 1``, ``len(k) > m``, ``np.ndim(lbnd) != 0``, or
        ``np.ndim(scl) != 0``.

    Notes
    -----
    Note that the result of each integration is *multiplied* by `scl`.
    Why is this important to note?  Say one is making a linear change of
    variable :math:`u = ax + b` in an integral relative to `x`.  Then
    :math:`dx = du/a`, so one will need to set `scl` equal to
    :math:`1/a`- perhaps not what one would have first thought.

    Also note that, in general, the result of integrating a C-series needs
    to be "reprojected" onto the C-series basis set.  Thus, typically,
    the result of this function is "unintuitive," albeit correct; see
    Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import chebyshev as C
    >>> c = (1,2,3)
    >>> C.chebint(c)
    array([ 0.5, -0.5,  0.5,  0.5])
    >>> C.chebint(c,3)
    array([ 0.03125   , -0.1875    ,  0.04166667, -0.05208333,  0.01041667,
            0.00625   ])
    >>> C.chebint(c, k=3)
    array([ 3.5, -0.5,  0.5,  0.5])
    >>> C.chebint(c,lbnd=-2)
    array([ 8.5, -0.5,  0.5,  0.5])
    >>> C.chebint(c,scl=-2)
    array([-1.,  1., -1., -1.])

    zspoly2cheb
    Add one Chebyshev series to another.

    Returns the sum of two Chebyshev series `c1` + `c2`.  The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients ordered from lowest order term to
    highest, i.e., [1,2,3] represents the series ``T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array representing the Chebyshev series of their sum.

    See Also
    --------
    chebsub, chebmulx, chebmul, chebdiv, chebpow

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the sum of two Chebyshev series
    is a Chebyshev series (without having to "reproject" the result onto
    the basis set) so addition, just like that of "standard" polynomials,
    is simply "component-wise."

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import chebyshev as C
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> C.chebadd(c1,c2)
    array([ 4.,  4.,  4.])

    _npts
    Evaluate a 3-D Chebyshev series on the Cartesian product of x, y, and z.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b,c) = \sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * T_i(a) * T_j(b) * T_k(c)

    where the points `(a, b, c)` consist of all triples formed by taking
    `a` from `x`, `b` from `y`, and `c` from `z`. The resulting points form
    a grid with `x` in the first dimension, `y` in the second, and `z` in
    the third.

    The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are converted to arrays only if they
    are tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In
    either case, either `x`, `y`, and `z` or their elements must support
    multiplication and addition both with themselves and with the elements
    of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than three dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 3-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[3:] +
    x.shape + y.shape + z.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible objects
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x`, `y`, and `z`.  If `x`,`y`, or `z` is a
        list or tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is
        left unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a
        scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree i,j are contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional polynomial at points in the Cartesian
        product of `x` and `y`.

    Notes
    -----

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    
    Generate a Chebyshev series with given roots.

    The function returns the coefficients of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = (x - r_0) * (x - r_1) * ... * (x - r_n),

    in Chebyshev form, where the `r_n` are the roots specified in `roots`.
    If a zero has multiplicity n, then it must appear in `roots` n times.
    For instance, if 2 is a root of multiplicity three and 3 is a root of
    multiplicity 2, then `roots` looks something like [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]. The
    roots can appear in any order.

    If the returned coefficients are `c`, then

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * T_1(x) + ... +  c_n * T_n(x)

    The coefficient of the last term is not generally 1 for monic
    polynomials in Chebyshev form.

    Parameters
    ----------
    roots : array_like
        Sequence containing the roots.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        1-D array of coefficients.  If all roots are real then `out` is a
        real array, if some of the roots are complex, then `out` is complex
        even if all the coefficients in the result are real (see Examples
        below).

    Examples

    >>> import numpy.polynomial.chebyshev as C
    >>> C.chebfromroots((-1,0,1)) # x^3 - x relative to the standard basis
    array([ 0.  , -0.25,  0.  ,  0.25])
    >>> j = complex(0,1)
    >>> C.chebfromroots((-j,j)) # x^2 + 1 relative to the standard basis

    /home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/polynomial/chebyshev.py
    Evaluate a 2-D Chebyshev series at points (x, y).

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(x,y) = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * T_i(x) * T_j(y)

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars and they
    must have the same shape after conversion. In either case, either `x`
    and `y` or their elements must support multiplication and addition both
    with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` is a 1-D array a one is implicitly appended to its shape to make
    it 2-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[2:] + x.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like, compatible objects
        The two dimensional series is evaluated at the points `(x, y)`,
        where `x` and `y` must have the same shape. If `x` or `y` is a list
        or tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is left
        unchanged and if it isn't an ndarray it is treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term
        of multi-degree i,j is contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has
        dimension greater than 2 the remaining indices enumerate multiple
        sets of coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional Chebyshev series at points formed
        from pairs of corresponding values from `x` and `y`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Integrate a z-series.

    The integral is with respect to x, not z. This is achieved by a change
    of variable using dx/dz given in the module notes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    zs : z-series
        The z-series to integrate

    Returns
    -------
    integral : z-series
        The indefinite integral

    Notes
    -----
    The zseries for x (ns) has been multiplied by two in order to avoid
    using floats that are incompatible with Decimal and likely other
    specialized scalar types. This scaling has been compensated by
    dividing the resulting zs by two.

    
    Compute the roots of a Chebyshev series.

    Return the roots (a.k.a. "zeros") of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = \sum_i c[i] * T_i(x).

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : 1-D array_like
        1-D array of coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of the roots of the series. If all the roots are real,
        then `out` is also real, otherwise it is complex.

    See Also
    --------
    polyroots, legroots, lagroots, hermroots, hermeroots

    Notes
    -----
    The root estimates are obtained as the eigenvalues of the companion
    matrix, Roots far from the origin of the complex plane may have large
    errors due to the numerical instability of the series for such
    values. Roots with multiplicity greater than 1 will also show larger
    errors as the value of the series near such points is relatively
    insensitive to errors in the roots. Isolated roots near the origin can
    be improved by a few iterations of Newton's method.

    The Chebyshev series basis polynomials aren't powers of `x` so the
    results of this function may seem unintuitive.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.polynomial.chebyshev as cheb
    >>> cheb.chebroots((-1, 1,-1, 1)) # T3 - T2 + T1 - T0 has real roots
    array([ -5.00000000e-01,   2.60860684e-17,   1.00000000e+00])

Notes
-----
The implementations of multiplication, division, integration, and
differentiation use the algebraic identities [1]_:

.. math ::
    T_n(x) = \frac{z^n + z^{-n}}{2} \\
    z\frac{dx}{dz} = \frac{z - z^{-1}}{2}.

where

.. math :: x = \frac{z + z^{-1}}{2}.

These identities allow a Chebyshev series to be expressed as a finite,
symmetric Laurent series.  In this module, this sort of Laurent series
is referred to as a "z-series."

Covert z-series to a Chebyshev series.

    Covert a z series to the equivalent Chebyshev series. The result is
    never an empty array. The dtype of the return is the same as that of
    the input. No checks are run on the arguments as this routine is for
    internal use.

    Parameters
    ----------
    zs : 1-D ndarray
        Odd length symmetric z-series, ordered from  low to high.

    Returns
    -------
    c : 1-D ndarray
        Chebyshev coefficients, ordered from  low to high.

    
    Chebyshev series whose graph is a straight line.



    Parameters
    ----------
    off, scl : scalars
        The specified line is given by ``off + scl*x``.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        This module's representation of the Chebyshev series for
        ``off + scl*x``.

    Multiply two z-series.

    Multiply two z-series to produce a z-series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    z1, z2 : 1-D ndarray
        The arrays must be 1-D but this is not checked.

    Returns
    -------
    product : 1-D ndarray
        The product z-series.

    Notes
    -----
    This is simply convolution. If symmetric/anti-symmetric z-series are
    denoted by S/A then the following rules apply:

    S*S, A*A -> S
    S*A, A*S -> A

    Differentiate a z-series.

    The derivative is with respect to x, not z. This is achieved using the
    chain rule and the value of dx/dz given in the module notes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    zs : z-series
        The z-series to differentiate.

    Returns
    -------
    derivative : z-series
        The derivative

    Notes
    -----
    The zseries for x (ns) has been multiplied by two in order to avoid
    using floats that are incompatible with Decimal and likely other
    specialized scalar types. This scaling has been compensated by
    multiplying the value of zs by two also so that the two cancels in the
    division.

    Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degrees.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degrees `deg` and sample
    points `(x, y, z)`. If `l, m, n` are the given degrees in `x, y, z`,
    then The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., (m+1)(n+1)i + (n+1)j + k] = T_i(x)*T_j(y)*T_k(z),

    where `0 <= i <= l`, `0 <= j <= m`, and `0 <= j <= n`.  The leading
    indices of `V` index the points `(x, y, z)` and the last index encodes
    the degrees of the Chebyshev polynomials.

    If ``V = chebvander3d(x, y, z, [xdeg, ydeg, zdeg])``, then the columns
    of `V` correspond to the elements of a 3-D coefficient array `c` of
    shape (xdeg + 1, ydeg + 1, zdeg + 1) in the order

    .. math:: c_{000}, c_{001}, c_{002},... , c_{010}, c_{011}, c_{012},...

    and ``np.dot(V, c.flat)`` and ``chebval3d(x, y, z, c)`` will be the
    same up to roundoff. This equivalence is useful both for least squares
    fitting and for the evaluation of a large number of 3-D Chebyshev
    series of the same degrees and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like
        Arrays of point coordinates, all of the same shape. The dtypes will
        be converted to either float64 or complex128 depending on whether
        any of the elements are complex. Scalars are converted to 1-D
        arrays.
    deg : list of ints
        List of maximum degrees of the form [x_deg, y_deg, z_deg].

    Returns
    -------
    vander3d : ndarray
        The shape of the returned matrix is ``x.shape + (order,)``, where
        :math:`order = (deg[0]+1)*(deg([1]+1)*(deg[2]+1)`.  The dtype will
        be the same as the converted `x`, `y`, and `z`.

       Values at which the weight function will be computed.

    Returns

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Raise a Chebyshev series to a power.

    Returns the Chebyshev series `c` raised to the power `pow`. The
    argument `c` is a sequence of coefficients ordered from low to high.
    i.e., [1,2,3] is the series  ``T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2.``

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.
    pow : integer
        Power to which the series will be raised
    maxpower : integer, optional
        Maximum power allowed. This is mainly to limit growth of the series
        to unmanageable size. Default is 16

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray
        Chebyshev series of power.

    See Also
    --------
    chebadd, chebsub, chebmulx, chebmul, chebdiv

    Examples
    --------

    array([15.5, 22. , 16. , 14. , 12.5, 12. ,  8. ])

    Return the scaled companion matrix of c.

    The basis polynomials are scaled so that the companion matrix is
    symmetric when `c` is a Chebyshev basis polynomial. This provides
    better eigenvalue estimates than the unscaled case and for basis
    polynomials the eigenvalues are guaranteed to be real if
    `numpy.linalg.eigvalsh` is used to obtain them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to high
        degree.

    Returns
    -------
    mat : ndarray
        Scaled companion matrix of dimensions (deg, deg).

    Convert a Chebyshev series to a polynomial.

    Convert an array representing the coefficients of a Chebyshev series,
    ordered from lowest degree to highest, to an array of the coefficients
    of the equivalent polynomial (relative to the "standard" basis) ordered
    from lowest to highest degree.

    Notes
    -----
    The easy way to do conversions between polynomial basis sets
    is to use the convert method of a class instance.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy import polynomial as P
    >>> c = P.Chebyshev(range(4))

    >>> P.chebyshev.cheb2poly(range(4))
    array([ -2.,  -8.,   4.,  12.])

    
    Differentiate a Chebyshev series.

    Returns the Chebyshev series coefficients `c` differentiated `m` times
    along `axis`.  At each iteration the result is multiplied by `scl` (the
    scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable). The argument
    `c` is an array of coefficients from low to high degree along each
    axis, e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series ``1*T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2``
    while [[1,2],[1,2]] represents ``1*T_0(x)*T_0(y) + 1*T_1(x)*T_0(y) +
    2*T_0(x)*T_1(y) + 2*T_1(x)*T_1(y)`` if axis=0 is ``x`` and axis=1 is
    ``y``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        Array of Chebyshev series coefficients. If c is multidimensional
        the different axis correspond to different variables with the
        degree in each axis given by the corresponding index.
    m : int, optional
        Number of derivatives taken, must be non-negative. (Default: 1)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Each differentiation is multiplied by `scl`.  The end result is
        multiplication by ``scl**m``.  This is for use in a linear change of
        variable. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the derivative is taken. (Default: 0).

    Returns
    -------
    der : ndarray
        Chebyshev series of the derivative.

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the result of differentiating a C-series needs to be
    "reprojected" onto the C-series basis set. Thus, typically, the
    result of this function is "unintuitive," albeit correct; see Examples
    section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import chebyshev as C
    >>> c = (1,2,3,4)
    >>> C.chebder(c)
    array([ 14.,  12.,  24.])
    >>> C.chebder(c,3)
    array([ 96.])
    >>> C.chebder(c,scl=-1)
    array([-14., -12., -24.])
    >>> C.chebder(c,2,-1)
    array([ 12.,  96.])

    
    Evaluate a 3-D Chebyshev series at points (x, y, z).

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(x,y,z) = \sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * T_i(x) * T_j(y) * T_k(z)

    The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are converted to arrays only if
    they are tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars and
    they must have the same shape after conversion. In either case, either
    `x`, `y`, and `z` or their elements must support multiplication and
    addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than 3 dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to its
    shape to make it 3-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[3:] +
    x.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible object
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points
        `(x, y, z)`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` must have the same shape.  If
        any of `x`, `y`, or `z` is a list or tuple, it is first converted
        to an ndarray, otherwise it is left unchanged and if it isn't an
        ndarray it is  treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term of
        multi-degree i,j,k is contained in ``c[i,j,k]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than 3 the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the multidimensional polynomial on points formed with
        triples of corresponding values from `x`, `y`, and `z`.

    xchebPseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degree.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degree `deg` and sample points
    `x`. The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., i] = T_i(x),

    where `0 <= i <= deg`. The leading indices of `V` index the elements of
    `x` and the last index is the degree of the Chebyshev polynomial.

    If `c` is a 1-D array of coefficients of length `n + 1` and `V` is the
    matrix ``V = chebvander(x, n)``, then ``np.dot(V, c)`` and
    ``chebval(x, c)`` are the same up to roundoff.  This equivalence is
    useful both for least squares fitting and for the evaluation of a large
    number of Chebyshev series of the same degree and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Array of points. The dtype is converted to float64 or complex128
        depending on whether any of the elements are complex. If `x` is
        scalar it is converted to a 1-D array.
    deg : int
        Degree of the resulting matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    vander : ndarray
        The pseudo Vandermonde matrix. The shape of the returned matrix is
        ``x.shape + (deg + 1,)``, where The last index is the degree of the
        corresponding Chebyshev polynomial.  The dtype will be the same as
        the converted `x`.

    A Chebyshev series class.

    The Chebyshev class provides the standard Python numerical methods
    '+', '-', '*', '//', '%', 'divmod', '**', and '()' as well as the
    methods listed below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coef : array_like
        Chebyshev coefficients in order of increasing degree, i.e.,
        ``(1, 2, 3)`` gives ``1*T_0(x) + 2*T_1(x) + 3*T_2(x)``.
    domain : (2,) array_like, optional
        Domain to use. The interval ``[domain[0], domain[1]]`` is mapped
        to the interval ``[window[0], window[1]]`` by shifting and scaling.
        The default value is [-1, 1].
    window : (2,) array_like, optional
        Window, see `domain` for its use. The default value is [-1, 1].

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    
    Convert a polynomial to a Chebyshev series.

    Convert an array representing the coefficients of a polynomial (relative
    to the "standard" basis) ordered from lowest degree to highest, to an
    array of the coefficients of the equivalent Chebyshev series, ordered
    from lowest to highest degree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pol : array_like
        1-D array containing the polynomial coefficients

    Returns
    -------
    c : ndarray
        1-D array containing the coefficients of the equivalent Chebyshev
        series.

    --------

    Notes
    -----
    The easy way to do conversions between polynomial basis sets
    is to use the convert method of a class instance.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy import polynomial as P
    >>> p = P.Polynomial(range(4))
    >>> p
    Polynomial([ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.], domain=[-1,  1], window=[-1,  1])
    >>> c = p.convert(kind=P.Chebyshev)
    >>> c
    Chebyshev([ 1.  ,  3.25,  1.  ,  0.75], domain=[-1,  1], window=[-1,  1])
    >>> P.chebyshev.poly2cheb(range(4))

    Evaluate a Chebyshev series at points x.

    If `c` is of length `n + 1`, this function returns the value:

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 * T_0(x) + c_1 * T_1(x) + ... + c_n * T_n(x)

    The parameter `x` is converted to an array only if it is a tuple or a
    list, otherwise it is treated as a scalar. In either case, either `x`
    or its elements must support multiplication and addition both with
    themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` is a 1-D array, then `p(x)` will have the same shape as `x`.  If
    `c` is multidimensional, then the shape of the result depends on the
    value of `tensor`. If `tensor` is true the shape will be c.shape[1:] +
    x.shape. If `tensor` is false the shape will be c.shape[1:]. Note that
    scalars have shape (,).

    Trailing zeros in the coefficients will be used in the evaluation, so
    they should be avoided if efficiency is a concern.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, compatible object
        If `x` is a list or tuple, it is converted to an ndarray, otherwise
        it is left unchanged and treated as a scalar. In either case, `x`
        or its elements must support addition and multiplication with
        with themselves and with the elements of `c`.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree n are contained in c[n]. If `c` is multidimensional the
        remaining indices enumerate multiple polynomials. In the two
        dimensional case the coefficients may be thought of as stored in
        the columns of `c`.
    tensor : boolean, optional
        If True, the shape of the coefficient array is extended with ones
        on the right, one for each dimension of `x`. Scalars have dimension 0
        for this action. The result is that every column of coefficients in
        `c` is evaluated for every element of `x`. If False, `x` is broadcast
        over the columns of `c` for the evaluation.  This keyword is useful
        when `c` is multidimensional. The default value is True.

    Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature.

    Computes the sample points and weights for Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature.
    These sample points and weights will correctly integrate polynomials of
    degree :math:`2*deg - 1` or less over the interval :math:`[-1, 1]` with
    the weight function :math:`f(x) = 1/\sqrt{1 - x^2}`.

    Parameters

    Returns
    -------
    x : ndarray
        1-D ndarray containing the sample points.

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    The results have only been tested up to degree 100, higher degrees may
    be problematic. For Gauss-Chebyshev there are closed form solutions for
    the sample points and weights. If n = `deg`, then

    .. math:: x_i = \cos(\pi (2 i - 1) / (2 n))

    .. math:: w_i = \pi / n

    <module numpy.polynomial.chebyshev>
    Chebyshev points of the second kind.

    The Chebyshev points of the second kind are the points ``cos(x)``,
    where ``x = [pi*k/(npts - 1) for k in range(npts)]``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    npts : int
        Number of sample points desired.

    _zseries_mul
    Least squares fit of Chebyshev series to data.

    Return the coefficients of a Chebyshev series of degree `deg` that is the
    least squares fit to the data values `y` given at points `x`. If `y` is
    1-D the returned coefficients will also be 1-D. If `y` is 2-D multiple
    fits are done, one for each column of `y`, and the resulting
    coefficients are stored in the corresponding columns of a 2-D return.
    The fitted polynomial(s) are in the form

    .. math::  p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * T_1(x) + ... + c_n * T_n(x),

    where `n` is `deg`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (M,)
        x-coordinates of the M sample points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
    y : array_like, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        y-coordinates of the sample points. Several data sets of sample
        points sharing the same x-coordinates can be fitted at once by
        passing in a 2D-array that contains one dataset per column.
    deg : int or 1-D array_like
        Degree(s) of the fitting polynomials. If `deg` is a single integer,
        all terms up to and including the `deg`'th term are included in the
        fit. For NumPy versions >= 1.11.0 a list of integers specifying the
        degrees of the terms to include may be used instead.
    rcond : float, optional
        Relative condition number of the fit. Singular values smaller than
        this relative to the largest singular value will be ignored. The
        default value is len(x)*eps, where eps is the relative precision of
        the float type, about 2e-16 in most cases.
    full : bool, optional
        Switch determining nature of return value. When it is False (the
        default) just the coefficients are returned, when True diagnostic
        information from the singular value decomposition is also returned.
    w : array_like, shape (`M`,), optional
        Weights. If not None, the contribution of each point
        ``(x[i],y[i])`` to the fit is weighted by `w[i]`. Ideally the
        weights are chosen so that the errors of the products ``w[i]*y[i]``
        all have the same variance.  The default value is None.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        Chebyshev coefficients ordered from low to high. If `y` was 2-D,
        the coefficients for the data in column k  of `y` are in column
        `k`.

    [residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond] : list
        These values are only returned if `full` = True

        resid -- sum of squared residuals of the least squares fit
        rank -- the numerical rank of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        sv -- singular values of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        rcond -- value of `rcond`.

        For more details, see `linalg.lstsq`.

    Warns
    -----
    RankWarning
        The rank of the coefficient matrix in the least-squares fit is
        deficient. The warning is only raised if `full` = False.  The
        warnings can be turned off by

        >>> import warnings

    Notes
    -----
    The solution is the coefficients of the Chebyshev series `p` that
    minimizes the sum of the weighted squared errors

    .. math:: E = \sum_j w_j^2 * |y_j - p(x_j)|^2,

    where :math:`w_j` are the weights. This problem is solved by setting up
    as the (typically) overdetermined matrix equation

    .. math:: V(x) * c = w * y,

    where `V` is the weighted pseudo Vandermonde matrix of `x`, `c` are the
    coefficients to be solved for, `w` are the weights, and `y` are the
    observed values.  This equation is then solved using the singular value
    decomposition of `V`.

    If some of the singular values of `V` are so small that they are
    neglected, then a `RankWarning` will be issued. This means that the
    coefficient values may be poorly determined. Using a lower order fit
    will usually get rid of the warning.  The `rcond` parameter can also be
    set to a value smaller than its default, but the resulting fit may be
    spurious and have large contributions from roundoff error.

    Fits using Chebyshev series are usually better conditioned than fits
    using power series, but much can depend on the distribution of the
    sample points and the smoothness of the data. If the quality of the fit
    is inadequate splines may be a good alternative.

        Parameters
        ----------
        func : function
            The function to be interpolated. It must be a function of a single
            variable of the form ``f(x, a, b, c...)``, where ``a, b, c...`` are
            extra arguments passed in the `args` parameter.

    Multiply one Chebyshev series by another.

    Returns the product of two Chebyshev series `c1` * `c2`.  The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients, from lowest order "term" to highest,
    e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series ``T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Of Chebyshev series coefficients representing their product.

    See Also
    --------
    chebadd, chebsub, chebmulx, chebdiv, chebpow

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the (polynomial) product of two C-series results in terms
    that are not in the Chebyshev polynomial basis set.  Thus, to express
    the product as a C-series, it is typically necessary to "reproject"
    the product onto said basis set, which typically produces
    "unintuitive live" (but correct) results; see Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import chebyshev as C
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> C.chebmul(c1,c2) # multiplication requires "reprojection"
    array([  6.5,  12. ,  12. ,   4. ,   1.5])

    deg must be an intCovert Chebyshev series to z-series.

    Covert a Chebyshev series to the equivalent z-series. The result is
    never an empty array. The dtype of the return is the same as that of
    the input. No checks are run on the arguments as this routine is for
    internal use.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : 1-D ndarray
        Chebyshev coefficients, ordered from low to high

    Returns
    -------
    zs : 1-D ndarray
        Odd length symmetric z-series, ordered from  low to high.

    _cseries_to_zseries
    Hermite series whose graph is a straight line.



    Parameters
    ----------
    off, scl : scalars
        The specified line is given by ``off + scl*x``.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        This module's representation of the Hermite series for
        ``off + scl*x``.

    Subtract one Hermite series from another.

    Returns the difference of two Hermite series `c1` - `c2`.  The
    sequences of coefficients are from lowest order term to highest, i.e.,
    [1,2,3] represents the series ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Of Hermite series coefficients representing their difference.

    See Also
    --------
    hermadd, hermmulx, hermmul, hermdiv, hermpow

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the difference of two Hermite
    series is a Hermite series (without having to "reproject" the result
    onto the basis set) so subtraction, just like that of "standard"
    polynomials, is simply "component-wise."

    Parameters
    ----------
    coef : array_like
        Hermite coefficients in order of increasing degree, i.e,
        ``(1, 2, 3)`` gives ``1*H_0(x) + 2*H_1(X) + 3*H_2(x)``.
    domain : (2,) array_like, optional
        Domain to use. The interval ``[domain[0], domain[1]]`` is mapped
        to the interval ``[window[0], window[1]]`` by shifting and scaling.
        The default value is [-1, 1].
    window : (2,) array_like, optional
        Window, see `domain` for its use. The default value is [-1, 1].

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    hermgaussReturn the scaled companion matrix of c.

    The basis polynomials are scaled so that the companion matrix is
    symmetric when `c` is an Hermite basis polynomial. This provides
    better eigenvalue estimates than the unscaled case and for basis
    polynomials the eigenvalues are guaranteed to be real if
    `numpy.linalg.eigvalsh` is used to obtain them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to high
        degree.

    Returns
    -------
    mat : ndarray
        Scaled companion matrix of dimensions (deg, deg).

    Generate a Hermite series with given roots.

    The function returns the coefficients of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = (x - r_0) * (x - r_1) * ... * (x - r_n),

    in Hermite form, where the `r_n` are the roots specified in `roots`.
    If a zero has multiplicity n, then it must appear in `roots` n times.
    For instance, if 2 is a root of multiplicity three and 3 is a root of
    multiplicity 2, then `roots` looks something like [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]. The
    roots can appear in any order.

    If the returned coefficients are `c`, then

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * H_1(x) + ... +  c_n * H_n(x)

    The coefficient of the last term is not generally 1 for monic
    polynomials in Hermite form.

    Parameters
    ----------
    roots : array_like
        Sequence containing the roots.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        1-D array of coefficients.  If all roots are real then `out` is a
        real array, if some of the roots are complex, then `out` is complex
        even if all the coefficients in the result are real (see Examples
        below).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite import hermfromroots, hermval
    >>> coef = hermfromroots((-1, 0, 1))
    >>> hermval((-1, 0, 1), coef)
    array([ 0.,  0.,  0.])
    >>> coef = hermfromroots((-1j, 1j))
    >>> hermval((-1j, 1j), coef)
    array([ 0.+0.j,  0.+0.j])

    
    Evaluate a 2-D Hermite series on the Cartesian product of x and y.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b) = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * H_i(a) * H_j(b)

    where the points `(a, b)` consist of all pairs formed by taking
    `a` from `x` and `b` from `y`. The resulting points form a grid with
    `x` in the first dimension and `y` in the second.

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In either
    case, either `x` and `y` or their elements must support multiplication
    and addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than two dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 2-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[2:] +
    x.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like, compatible objects
        The two dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x` and `y`.  If `x` or `y` is a list or
        tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is left
        unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree i,j are contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional polynomial at points in the Cartesian
        product of `x` and `y`.

    _normed_hermite_n
    Add one Hermite series to another.

    Returns the sum of two Hermite series `c1` + `c2`.  The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients ordered from lowest order term to
    highest, i.e., [1,2,3] represents the series ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array representing the Hermite series of their sum.

    See Also
    --------
    hermsub, hermmulx, hermmul, hermdiv, hermpow

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the sum of two Hermite series
    is a Hermite series (without having to "reproject" the result onto
    the basis set) so addition, just like that of "standard" polynomials,
    is simply "component-wise."

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite import hermadd
    >>> hermadd([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4])
    array([ 2.,  4.,  6.,  4.])

    poly2hermhermzeroMultiply a Hermite series by x.

    Multiply the Hermite series `c` by x, where x is the independent
    variable.


    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array representing the result of the multiplication.

    See Also
    --------
    hermadd, hermsub, hermmul, hermdiv, hermpow

    Notes
    -----
    The multiplication uses the recursion relationship for Hermite
    polynomials in the form

    .. math::

    xP_i(x) = (P_{i + 1}(x)/2 + i*P_{i - 1}(x))

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite import hermmulx
    >>> hermmulx([1, 2, 3])
    array([ 2. ,  6.5,  1. ,  1.5])

    hermcompanionhermgrid2d
    poly2herm(pol)

    Convert a polynomial to a Hermite series.

    Convert an array representing the coefficients of a polynomial (relative
    to the "standard" basis) ordered from lowest degree to highest, to an
    array of the coefficients of the equivalent Hermite series, ordered
    from lowest to highest degree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pol : array_like
        1-D array containing the polynomial coefficients

    Returns
    -------
    c : ndarray
        1-D array containing the coefficients of the equivalent Hermite
        series.

    See Also
    --------
    herm2poly

    Notes
    -----
    The easy way to do conversions between polynomial basis sets
    is to use the convert method of a class instance.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite import poly2herm
    >>> poly2herm(np.arange(4))
    array([ 1.   ,  2.75 ,  0.5  ,  0.375])

    
    Least squares fit of Hermite series to data.

    Return the coefficients of a Hermite series of degree `deg` that is the
    least squares fit to the data values `y` given at points `x`. If `y` is
    1-D the returned coefficients will also be 1-D. If `y` is 2-D multiple
    fits are done, one for each column of `y`, and the resulting
    coefficients are stored in the corresponding columns of a 2-D return.
    The fitted polynomial(s) are in the form

    .. math::  p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * H_1(x) + ... + c_n * H_n(x),

    where `n` is `deg`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (M,)
        x-coordinates of the M sample points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
    y : array_like, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        y-coordinates of the sample points. Several data sets of sample
        points sharing the same x-coordinates can be fitted at once by
        passing in a 2D-array that contains one dataset per column.
    deg : int or 1-D array_like
        Degree(s) of the fitting polynomials. If `deg` is a single integer
        all terms up to and including the `deg`'th term are included in the
        fit. For NumPy versions >= 1.11.0 a list of integers specifying the
        degrees of the terms to include may be used instead.
    rcond : float, optional
        Relative condition number of the fit. Singular values smaller than
        this relative to the largest singular value will be ignored. The
        default value is len(x)*eps, where eps is the relative precision of
        the float type, about 2e-16 in most cases.
    full : bool, optional
        Switch determining nature of return value. When it is False (the
        default) just the coefficients are returned, when True diagnostic
        information from the singular value decomposition is also returned.
    w : array_like, shape (`M`,), optional
        Weights. If not None, the contribution of each point
        ``(x[i],y[i])`` to the fit is weighted by `w[i]`. Ideally the
        weights are chosen so that the errors of the products ``w[i]*y[i]``
        all have the same variance.  The default value is None.

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        Hermite coefficients ordered from low to high. If `y` was 2-D,
        the coefficients for the data in column k  of `y` are in column
        `k`.

    [residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond] : list
        These values are only returned if `full` = True

        resid -- sum of squared residuals of the least squares fit
        rank -- the numerical rank of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        sv -- singular values of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        rcond -- value of `rcond`.

        For more details, see `linalg.lstsq`.

    Warns
    -----
    RankWarning
        The rank of the coefficient matrix in the least-squares fit is
        deficient. The warning is only raised if `full` = False.  The
        warnings can be turned off by

        >>> import warnings
        >>> warnings.simplefilter('ignore', RankWarning)

    scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline : Computes spline fits.

    Notes
    -----
    The solution is the coefficients of the Hermite series `p` that
    minimizes the sum of the weighted squared errors

    .. math:: E = \sum_j w_j^2 * |y_j - p(x_j)|^2,

    where the :math:`w_j` are the weights. This problem is solved by
    setting up the (typically) overdetermined matrix equation

    .. math:: V(x) * c = w * y,

    where `V` is the weighted pseudo Vandermonde matrix of `x`, `c` are the
    coefficients to be solved for, `w` are the weights, `y` are the
    observed values.  This equation is then solved using the singular value
    decomposition of `V`.

    If some of the singular values of `V` are so small that they are
    neglected, then a `RankWarning` will be issued. This means that the
    coefficient values may be poorly determined. Using a lower order fit
    will usually get rid of the warning.  The `rcond` parameter can also be
    set to a value smaller than its default, but the resulting fit may be
    spurious and have large contributions from roundoff error.

    Fits using Hermite series are probably most useful when the data can be
    approximated by ``sqrt(w(x)) * p(x)``, where `w(x)` is the Hermite
    weight. In that case the weight ``sqrt(w(x[i])`` should be used
    together with data values ``y[i]/sqrt(w(x[i])``. The weight function is
    available as `hermweight`.

    hermtrim
    Evaluate an Hermite series at points x.

    If `c` is of length `n + 1`, this function returns the value:

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 * H_0(x) + c_1 * H_1(x) + ... + c_n * H_n(x)

    The parameter `x` is converted to an array only if it is a tuple or a
    list, otherwise it is treated as a scalar. In either case, either `x`
    or its elements must support multiplication and addition both with
    themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` is a 1-D array, then `p(x)` will have the same shape as `x`.  If
    `c` is multidimensional, then the shape of the result depends on the
    value of `tensor`. If `tensor` is true the shape will be c.shape[1:] +
    x.shape. If `tensor` is false the shape will be c.shape[1:]. Note that
    scalars have shape (,).

    Trailing zeros in the coefficients will be used in the evaluation, so
    they should be avoided if efficiency is a concern.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, compatible object
        If `x` is a list or tuple, it is converted to an ndarray, otherwise
        it is left unchanged and treated as a scalar. In either case, `x`
        or its elements must support addition and multiplication with
        with themselves and with the elements of `c`.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree n are contained in c[n]. If `c` is multidimensional the
        remaining indices enumerate multiple polynomials. In the two
        dimensional case the coefficients may be thought of as stored in
        the columns of `c`.
    tensor : boolean, optional
        If True, the shape of the coefficient array is extended with ones
        on the right, one for each dimension of `x`. Scalars have dimension 0
        for this action. The result is that every column of coefficients in
        `c` is evaluated for every element of `x`. If False, `x` is broadcast
        over the columns of `c` for the evaluation.  This keyword is useful
        when `c` is multidimensional. The default value is True.

    Notes
    -----
    The evaluation uses Clenshaw recursion, aka synthetic division.

    >>> hermval(1, coef)

    Differentiate a Hermite series.

    Returns the Hermite series coefficients `c` differentiated `m` times
    along `axis`.  At each iteration the result is multiplied by `scl` (the
    scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable). The argument
    `c` is an array of coefficients from low to high degree along each
    axis, e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series ``1*H_0 + 2*H_1 + 3*H_2``
    while [[1,2],[1,2]] represents ``1*H_0(x)*H_0(y) + 1*H_1(x)*H_0(y) +
    2*H_0(x)*H_1(y) + 2*H_1(x)*H_1(y)`` if axis=0 is ``x`` and axis=1 is
    ``y``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        Array of Hermite series coefficients. If `c` is multidimensional the
        different axis correspond to different variables with the degree in
        each axis given by the corresponding index.
    m : int, optional
        Number of derivatives taken, must be non-negative. (Default: 1)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Each differentiation is multiplied by `scl`.  The end result is
        multiplication by ``scl**m``.  This is for use in a linear change of
        variable. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the derivative is taken. (Default: 0).

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    der : ndarray
        Hermite series of the derivative.

    See Also
    --------
    hermint

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the result of differentiating a Hermite series does not
    resemble the same operation on a power series. Thus the result of this
    function may be "unintuitive," albeit correct; see Examples section
    below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite import hermder
    >>> hermder([ 1. ,  0.5,  0.5,  0.5])
    array([ 1.,  2.,  3.])
    >>> hermder([-0.5,  1./2.,  1./8.,  1./12.,  1./16.], m=2)
    array([ 1.,  2.,  3.])

    Raise a Hermite series to a power.

    Returns the Hermite series `c` raised to the power `pow`. The
    argument `c` is a sequence of coefficients ordered from low to high.
    i.e., [1,2,3] is the series  ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2.``

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.
    pow : integer
        Power to which the series will be raised
    maxpower : integer, optional
        Maximum power allowed. This is mainly to limit growth of the series
        to unmanageable size. Default is 16

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray
        Hermite series of power.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite import hermpow

    array([ 81.,  52.,  82.,  12.,   9.])

    
    Integrate a Hermite series.

    Returns the Hermite series coefficients `c` integrated `m` times from
    `lbnd` along `axis`. At each iteration the resulting series is
    **multiplied** by `scl` and an integration constant, `k`, is added.
    The scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable.  ("Buyer
    beware": note that, depending on what one is doing, one may want `scl`
    to be the reciprocal of what one might expect; for more information,
    see the Notes section below.)  The argument `c` is an array of
    coefficients from low to high degree along each axis, e.g., [1,2,3]
    represents the series ``H_0 + 2*H_1 + 3*H_2`` while [[1,2],[1,2]]
    represents ``1*H_0(x)*H_0(y) + 1*H_1(x)*H_0(y) + 2*H_0(x)*H_1(y) +
    2*H_1(x)*H_1(y)`` if axis=0 is ``x`` and axis=1 is ``y``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        Array of Hermite series coefficients. If c is multidimensional the
        different axis correspond to different variables with the degree in
        each axis given by the corresponding index.
    m : int, optional
        Order of integration, must be positive. (Default: 1)
    k : {[], list, scalar}, optional
        Integration constant(s).  The value of the first integral at
        ``lbnd`` is the first value in the list, the value of the second
        integral at ``lbnd`` is the second value, etc.  If ``k == []`` (the
        default), all constants are set to zero.  If ``m == 1``, a single
        scalar can be given instead of a list.
    lbnd : scalar, optional
        The lower bound of the integral. (Default: 0)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Following each integration the result is *multiplied* by `scl`
        before the integration constant is added. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the integral is taken. (Default: 0).

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    S : ndarray
        Hermite series coefficients of the integral.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``m < 0``, ``len(k) > m``, ``np.ndim(lbnd) != 0``, or
        ``np.ndim(scl) != 0``.

    See Also
    --------
    hermder

    Notes
    -----
    Note that the result of each integration is *multiplied* by `scl`.
    Why is this important to note?  Say one is making a linear change of
    variable :math:`u = ax + b` in an integral relative to `x`.  Then
    :math:`dx = du/a`, so one will need to set `scl` equal to
    :math:`1/a` - perhaps not what one would have first thought.

    Also note that, in general, the result of integrating a C-series needs
    to be "reprojected" onto the C-series basis set.  Thus, typically,
    the result of this function is "unintuitive," albeit correct; see
    Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite import hermint
    >>> hermint([1,2,3]) # integrate once, value 0 at 0.

    Gauss-Hermite quadrature.

    with the weight function :math:`f(x) = \exp(-x^2)`.

    Parameters

    deg : int
        Number of sample points and weights. It must be >= 1.

    Returns
    -------
    x : ndarray
        1-D ndarray containing the sample points.

    The results have only been tested up to degree 100, higher degrees may
    be problematic. The weights are determined by using the fact that

    .. math:: w_k = c / (H'_n(x_k) * H_{n-1}(x_k))

    where :math:`c` is a constant independent of :math:`k` and :math:`x_k`
    is the k'th root of :math:`H_n`, and then scaling the results to get
    the right value when integrating 1.

    
    Evaluate a 3-D Hermite series on the Cartesian product of x, y, and z.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b,c) = \sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * H_i(a) * H_j(b) * H_k(c)

    where the points `(a, b, c)` consist of all triples formed by taking
    `a` from `x`, `b` from `y`, and `c` from `z`. The resulting points form
    a grid with `x` in the first dimension, `y` in the second, and `z` in
    the third.

    The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are converted to arrays only if they
    are tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In
    either case, either `x`, `y`, and `z` or their elements must support
    multiplication and addition both with themselves and with the elements
    of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than three dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 3-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[3:] +
    x.shape + y.shape + z.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible objects
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x`, `y`, and `z`.  If `x`,`y`, or `z` is a
        list or tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is
        left unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a
        scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree i,j are contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional polynomial at points in the Cartesian
        product of `x` and `y`.

    Compute the roots of a Hermite series.

    Return the roots (a.k.a. "zeros") of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = \sum_i c[i] * H_i(x).

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : 1-D array_like
        1-D array of coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of the roots of the series. If all the roots are real,
        then `out` is also real, otherwise it is complex.

    See Also
    --------
    polyroots, legroots, lagroots, chebroots, hermeroots

    Notes
    -----
    The root estimates are obtained as the eigenvalues of the companion
    matrix, Roots far from the origin of the complex plane may have large
    errors due to the numerical instability of the series for such
    values. Roots with multiplicity greater than 1 will also show larger
    errors as the value of the series near such points is relatively
    insensitive to errors in the roots. Isolated roots near the origin can
    be improved by a few iterations of Newton's method.

    The Hermite series basis polynomials aren't powers of `x` so the
    results of this function may seem unintuitive.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite import hermroots, hermfromroots
    >>> coef = hermfromroots([-1, 0, 1])
    >>> coef
    array([ 0.   ,  0.25 ,  0.   ,  0.125])
    >>> hermroots(coef)

    <module numpy.polynomial.hermite>/home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/polynomial/hermite.py
    Multiply one Hermite series by another.

    Returns the product of two Hermite series `c1` * `c2`.  The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients, from lowest order "term" to highest,
    e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Of Hermite series coefficients representing their product.

    See Also
    --------
    hermadd, hermsub, hermmulx, hermdiv, hermpow

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the (polynomial) product of two C-series results in terms
    that are not in the Hermite polynomial basis set.  Thus, to express
    the product as a Hermite series, it is necessary to "reproject" the
    product onto said basis set, which may produce "unintuitive" (but
    correct) results; see Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite import hermmul
    >>> hermmul([1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2])
    array([ 52.,  29.,  52.,   7.,   6.])

    Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degrees.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degrees `deg` and sample
    points `(x, y, z)`. If `l, m, n` are the given degrees in `x, y, z`,
    then The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., (m+1)(n+1)i + (n+1)j + k] = H_i(x)*H_j(y)*H_k(z),

    where `0 <= i <= l`, `0 <= j <= m`, and `0 <= j <= n`.  The leading
    indices of `V` index the points `(x, y, z)` and the last index encodes
    the degrees of the Hermite polynomials.

    If ``V = hermvander3d(x, y, z, [xdeg, ydeg, zdeg])``, then the columns
    of `V` correspond to the elements of a 3-D coefficient array `c` of
    shape (xdeg + 1, ydeg + 1, zdeg + 1) in the order

    .. math:: c_{000}, c_{001}, c_{002},... , c_{010}, c_{011}, c_{012},...

    and  ``np.dot(V, c.flat)`` and ``hermval3d(x, y, z, c)`` will be the
    same up to roundoff. This equivalence is useful both for least squares
    fitting and for the evaluation of a large number of 3-D Hermite
    series of the same degrees and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like
        Arrays of point coordinates, all of the same shape. The dtypes will
        be converted to either float64 or complex128 depending on whether
        any of the elements are complex. Scalars are converted to 1-D
        arrays.
    deg : list of ints
        List of maximum degrees of the form [x_deg, y_deg, z_deg].

    Returns
    -------
    vander3d : ndarray
        The shape of the returned matrix is ``x.shape + (order,)``, where
        :math:`order = (deg[0]+1)*(deg([1]+1)*(deg[2]+1)`.  The dtype will
        be the same as the converted `x`, `y`, and `z`.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(x,y) = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * H_i(x) * H_j(y)

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars and they
    must have the same shape after conversion. In either case, either `x`
    and `y` or their elements must support multiplication and addition both
    with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` is a 1-D array a one is implicitly appended to its shape to make

    x, y : array_like, compatible objects
        The two dimensional series is evaluated at the points `(x, y)`,
        where `x` and `y` must have the same shape. If `x` or `y` is a list

Weight function of the Hermite_e polynomials.

    The weight function is :math:`\exp(-x^2/2)` and the interval of
    integration is :math:`[-\inf, \inf]`. the HermiteE polynomials are
    orthogonal, but not normalized, with respect to this weight function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
       Values at which the weight function will be computed.

    Returns
    -------
    w : ndarray
       The weight function at `x`.

    at the points ``x``.


    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray of double.

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    This function is needed for finding the Gauss points and integration
    weights for high degrees. The values of the standard HermiteE functions
    overflow when n >= 207.

    Raise a Hermite series to a power.

    Returns the Hermite series `c` raised to the power `pow`. The
    argument `c` is a sequence of coefficients ordered from low to high.
    i.e., [1,2,3] is the series  ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2.``

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.
    pow : integer
        Power to which the series will be raised
    maxpower : integer, optional
        Maximum power allowed. This is mainly to limit growth of the series
        to unmanageable size. Default is 16

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray
        Hermite series of power.

    array([ 23.,  28.,  46.,  12.,   9.])

    
    Divide one Hermite series by another.

    Returns the quotient-with-remainder of two Hermite series
    `c1` / `c2`.  The arguments are sequences of coefficients from lowest
    order "term" to highest, e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series
    ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    [quo, rem] : ndarrays
        Of Hermite series coefficients representing the quotient and
        remainder.

    See Also
    --------
    hermeadd, hermesub, hermemulx, hermemul, hermepow

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the (polynomial) division of one Hermite series by another
    results in quotient and remainder terms that are not in the Hermite
    polynomial basis set.  Thus, to express these results as a Hermite
    series, it is necessary to "reproject" the results onto the Hermite
    basis set, which may produce "unintuitive" (but correct) results; see
    Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermediv
    >>> hermediv([ 14.,  15.,  28.,   7.,   6.], [0, 1, 2])
    (array([ 1.,  2.,  3.]), array([ 0.]))
    >>> hermediv([ 15.,  17.,  28.,   7.,   6.], [0, 1, 2])
    (array([ 1.,  2.,  3.]), array([ 1.,  2.]))

    Multiply a Hermite series by x.

    Multiply the Hermite series `c` by x, where x is the independent
    variable.


    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array representing the result of the multiplication.

    Notes
    -----
    The multiplication uses the recursion relationship for Hermite
    polynomials in the form

    .. math::

    xP_i(x) = (P_{i + 1}(x) + iP_{i - 1}(x)))

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermemulx
    >>> hermemulx([1, 2, 3])
    array([ 2.,  7.,  2.,  3.])

    Evaluate an HermiteE series at points x.

    If `c` is of length `n + 1`, this function returns the value:

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 * He_0(x) + c_1 * He_1(x) + ... + c_n * He_n(x)

    The parameter `x` is converted to an array only if it is a tuple or a
    list, otherwise it is treated as a scalar. In either case, either `x`
    or its elements must support multiplication and addition both with
    themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` is a 1-D array, then `p(x)` will have the same shape as `x`.  If
    `c` is multidimensional, then the shape of the result depends on the
    value of `tensor`. If `tensor` is true the shape will be c.shape[1:] +
    x.shape. If `tensor` is false the shape will be c.shape[1:]. Note that
    scalars have shape (,).

    Trailing zeros in the coefficients will be used in the evaluation, so
    they should be avoided if efficiency is a concern.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, compatible object
        If `x` is a list or tuple, it is converted to an ndarray, otherwise
        it is left unchanged and treated as a scalar. In either case, `x`
        or its elements must support addition and multiplication with
        with themselves and with the elements of `c`.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree n are contained in c[n]. If `c` is multidimensional the
        remaining indices enumerate multiple polynomials. In the two
        dimensional case the coefficients may be thought of as stored in
        the columns of `c`.
    tensor : boolean, optional
        If True, the shape of the coefficient array is extended with ones
        on the right, one for each dimension of `x`. Scalars have dimension 0
        for this action. The result is that every column of coefficients in
        `c` is evaluated for every element of `x`. If False, `x` is broadcast
        over the columns of `c` for the evaluation.  This keyword is useful
        when `c` is multidimensional. The default value is True.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, algebra_like
        The shape of the return value is described above.

    See Also
    --------
    hermeval2d, hermegrid2d, hermeval3d, hermegrid3d

    Notes
    -----
    The evaluation uses Clenshaw recursion, aka synthetic division.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermeval
    >>> coef = [1,2,3]
    >>> hermeval(1, coef)
    3.0
    >>> hermeval([[1,2],[3,4]], coef)
    array([[  3.,  14.],
           [ 31.,  54.]])

    
    Add one Hermite series to another.

    Returns the sum of two Hermite series `c1` + `c2`.  The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients ordered from lowest order term to
    highest, i.e., [1,2,3] represents the series ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array representing the Hermite series of their sum.

    See Also
    --------
    hermesub, hermemulx, hermemul, hermediv, hermepow

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the sum of two Hermite series
    is a Hermite series (without having to "reproject" the result onto
    the basis set) so addition, just like that of "standard" polynomials,
    is simply "component-wise."

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermeadd
    >>> hermeadd([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4])
    array([ 2.,  4.,  6.,  4.])

    
    Integrate a Hermite_e series.

    Returns the Hermite_e series coefficients `c` integrated `m` times from
    `lbnd` along `axis`. At each iteration the resulting series is
    **multiplied** by `scl` and an integration constant, `k`, is added.
    The scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable.  ("Buyer
    beware": note that, depending on what one is doing, one may want `scl`
    to be the reciprocal of what one might expect; for more information,
    see the Notes section below.)  The argument `c` is an array of
    coefficients from low to high degree along each axis, e.g., [1,2,3]
    represents the series ``H_0 + 2*H_1 + 3*H_2`` while [[1,2],[1,2]]
    represents ``1*H_0(x)*H_0(y) + 1*H_1(x)*H_0(y) + 2*H_0(x)*H_1(y) +
    2*H_1(x)*H_1(y)`` if axis=0 is ``x`` and axis=1 is ``y``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        Array of Hermite_e series coefficients. If c is multidimensional
        the different axis correspond to different variables with the
        degree in each axis given by the corresponding index.
    m : int, optional
        Order of integration, must be positive. (Default: 1)
    k : {[], list, scalar}, optional
        Integration constant(s).  The value of the first integral at
        ``lbnd`` is the first value in the list, the value of the second
        integral at ``lbnd`` is the second value, etc.  If ``k == []`` (the
        default), all constants are set to zero.  If ``m == 1``, a single
        scalar can be given instead of a list.
    lbnd : scalar, optional
        The lower bound of the integral. (Default: 0)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Following each integration the result is *multiplied* by `scl`
        before the integration constant is added. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the integral is taken. (Default: 0).

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    S : ndarray
        Hermite_e series coefficients of the integral.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``m < 0``, ``len(k) > m``, ``np.ndim(lbnd) != 0``, or
        ``np.ndim(scl) != 0``.

    See Also
    --------
    hermeder

    Notes
    -----
    Note that the result of each integration is *multiplied* by `scl`.
    Why is this important to note?  Say one is making a linear change of
    variable :math:`u = ax + b` in an integral relative to `x`.  Then
    :math:`dx = du/a`, so one will need to set `scl` equal to
    :math:`1/a` - perhaps not what one would have first thought.

    Also note that, in general, the result of integrating a C-series needs
    to be "reprojected" onto the C-series basis set.  Thus, typically,
    the result of this function is "unintuitive," albeit correct; see
    Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermeint
    >>> hermeint([1, 2, 3]) # integrate once, value 0 at 0.
    array([ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])
    >>> hermeint([1, 2, 3], m=2) # integrate twice, value & deriv 0 at 0
    array([-0.25      ,  1.        ,  0.5       ,  0.33333333,  0.25      ])
    >>> hermeint([1, 2, 3], k=1) # integrate once, value 1 at 0.
    array([ 2.,  1.,  1.,  1.])
    >>> hermeint([1, 2, 3], lbnd=-1) # integrate once, value 0 at -1
    array([-1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])
    >>> hermeint([1, 2, 3], m=2, k=[1, 2], lbnd=-1)
    array([ 1.83333333,  0.        ,  0.5       ,  0.33333333,  0.25      ])

    
    Convert a Hermite series to a polynomial.

    Convert an array representing the coefficients of a Hermite series,
    ordered from lowest degree to highest, to an array of the coefficients
    of the equivalent polynomial (relative to the "standard" basis) ordered
    from lowest to highest degree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array containing the Hermite series coefficients, ordered
        from lowest order term to highest.

    Returns
    -------
    pol : ndarray
        1-D array containing the coefficients of the equivalent polynomial
        (relative to the "standard" basis) ordered from lowest order term
        to highest.

    Notes
    -----
    The easy way to do conversions between polynomial basis sets
    is to use the convert method of a class instance.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import herme2poly
    >>> herme2poly([  2.,  10.,   2.,   3.])
    array([ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.])

    An HermiteE series class.

    The HermiteE class provides the standard Python numerical methods
    '+', '-', '*', '//', '%', 'divmod', '**', and '()' as well as the
    attributes and methods listed in the `ABCPolyBase` documentation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coef : array_like
        HermiteE coefficients in order of increasing degree, i.e,
        ``(1, 2, 3)`` gives ``1*He_0(x) + 2*He_1(X) + 3*He_2(x)``.
    domain : (2,) array_like, optional
        Domain to use. The interval ``[domain[0], domain[1]]`` is mapped
        to the interval ``[window[0], window[1]]`` by shifting and scaling.
        The default value is [-1, 1].
    window : (2,) array_like, optional
        Window, see `domain` for its use. The default value is [-1, 1].

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    
    Least squares fit of Hermite series to data.

    Return the coefficients of a HermiteE series of degree `deg` that is
    the least squares fit to the data values `y` given at points `x`. If
    `y` is 1-D the returned coefficients will also be 1-D. If `y` is 2-D
    multiple fits are done, one for each column of `y`, and the resulting
    coefficients are stored in the corresponding columns of a 2-D return.
    The fitted polynomial(s) are in the form

    .. math::  p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * He_1(x) + ... + c_n * He_n(x),

    where `n` is `deg`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (M,)
        x-coordinates of the M sample points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
    y : array_like, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        y-coordinates of the sample points. Several data sets of sample
        points sharing the same x-coordinates can be fitted at once by
        passing in a 2D-array that contains one dataset per column.
    deg : int or 1-D array_like
        Degree(s) of the fitting polynomials. If `deg` is a single integer
        all terms up to and including the `deg`'th term are included in the
        fit. For NumPy versions >= 1.11.0 a list of integers specifying the
        degrees of the terms to include may be used instead.
    rcond : float, optional
        Relative condition number of the fit. Singular values smaller than
        this relative to the largest singular value will be ignored. The
        default value is len(x)*eps, where eps is the relative precision of
        the float type, about 2e-16 in most cases.
    full : bool, optional
        Switch determining nature of return value. When it is False (the
        default) just the coefficients are returned, when True diagnostic
        information from the singular value decomposition is also returned.
    w : array_like, shape (`M`,), optional
        Weights. If not None, the contribution of each point
        ``(x[i],y[i])`` to the fit is weighted by `w[i]`. Ideally the
        weights are chosen so that the errors of the products ``w[i]*y[i]``
        all have the same variance.  The default value is None.

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        Hermite coefficients ordered from low to high. If `y` was 2-D,
        the coefficients for the data in column k  of `y` are in column
        `k`.

    [residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond] : list
        These values are only returned if `full` = True

        resid -- sum of squared residuals of the least squares fit
        rank -- the numerical rank of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        sv -- singular values of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        rcond -- value of `rcond`.

        For more details, see `linalg.lstsq`.

    Warns
    -----
    RankWarning
        The rank of the coefficient matrix in the least-squares fit is
        deficient. The warning is only raised if `full` = False.  The
        warnings can be turned off by

        >>> import warnings
        >>> warnings.simplefilter('ignore', RankWarning)

    Notes
    -----
    The solution is the coefficients of the HermiteE series `p` that
    minimizes the sum of the weighted squared errors

    .. math:: E = \sum_j w_j^2 * |y_j - p(x_j)|^2,

    where the :math:`w_j` are the weights. This problem is solved by
    setting up the (typically) overdetermined matrix equation

    .. math:: V(x) * c = w * y,

    where `V` is the pseudo Vandermonde matrix of `x`, the elements of `c`
    are the coefficients to be solved for, and the elements of `y` are the
    observed values.  This equation is then solved using the singular value
    decomposition of `V`.

    If some of the singular values of `V` are so small that they are
    neglected, then a `RankWarning` will be issued. This means that the
    coefficient values may be poorly determined. Using a lower order fit
    will usually get rid of the warning.  The `rcond` parameter can also be
    set to a value smaller than its default, but the resulting fit may be
    spurious and have large contributions from roundoff error.

    Fits using HermiteE series are probably most useful when the data can
    be approximated by ``sqrt(w(x)) * p(x)``, where `w(x)` is the HermiteE
    weight. In that case the weight ``sqrt(w(x[i])`` should be used
    together with data values ``y[i]/sqrt(w(x[i])``. The weight function is
    available as `hermeweight`.

    Gauss-HermiteE quadrature.

    Computes the sample points and weights for Gauss-HermiteE quadrature.
    These sample points and weights will correctly integrate polynomials of
    degree :math:`2*deg - 1` or less over the interval :math:`[-\inf, \inf]`
    with the weight function :math:`f(x) = \exp(-x^2/2)`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    deg : int
        Number of sample points and weights. It must be >= 1.

    Returns
    -------
    x : ndarray
        1-D ndarray containing the sample points.

    Notes

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    The results have only been tested up to degree 100, higher degrees may
    be problematic. The weights are determined by using the fact that

    .. math:: w_k = c / (He'_n(x_k) * He_{n-1}(x_k))

    where :math:`c` is a constant independent of :math:`k` and :math:`x_k`
    is the k'th root of :math:`He_n`, and then scaling the results to get
    the right value when integrating 1.

    >>> poly2herme(np.arange(4))
    array([  2.,  10.,   2.,   3.])

    
    Evaluate a 3-D HermiteE series on the Cartesian product of x, y, and z.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b,c) = \sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * He_i(a) * He_j(b) * He_k(c)

    where the points `(a, b, c)` consist of all triples formed by taking
    `a` from `x`, `b` from `y`, and `c` from `z`. The resulting points form
    a grid with `x` in the first dimension, `y` in the second, and `z` in
    the third.

    The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are converted to arrays only if they
    are tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In
    either case, either `x`, `y`, and `z` or their elements must support
    multiplication and addition both with themselves and with the elements
    of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than three dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 3-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[3:] +
    x.shape + y.shape + z.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible objects
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x`, `y`, and `z`.  If `x`,`y`, or `z` is a
        list or tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is
        left unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a
        scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree i,j are contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional polynomial at points in the Cartesian
        product of `x` and `y`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degree.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degree `deg` and sample points
    `x`. The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., i] = He_i(x),

    where `0 <= i <= deg`. The leading indices of `V` index the elements of
    `x` and the last index is the degree of the HermiteE polynomial.

    If `c` is a 1-D array of coefficients of length `n + 1` and `V` is the
    array ``V = hermevander(x, n)``, then ``np.dot(V, c)`` and
    ``hermeval(x, c)`` are the same up to roundoff. This equivalence is
    useful both for least squares fitting and for the evaluation of a large
    number of HermiteE series of the same degree and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Array of points. The dtype is converted to float64 or complex128
        depending on whether any of the elements are complex. If `x` is
        scalar it is converted to a 1-D array.
    deg : int
        Degree of the resulting matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    vander : ndarray
        The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix. The shape of the returned matrix is
        ``x.shape + (deg + 1,)``, where The last index is the degree of the
        corresponding HermiteE polynomial.  The dtype will be the same as
        the converted `x`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermevander
    >>> x = np.array([-1, 0, 1])
    >>> hermevander(x, 3)
    array([[ 1., -1.,  0.,  2.],
           [ 1.,  0., -1., -0.],
           [ 1.,  1.,  0., -2.]])

    
    Generate a HermiteE series with given roots.

    The function returns the coefficients of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = (x - r_0) * (x - r_1) * ... * (x - r_n),

    in HermiteE form, where the `r_n` are the roots specified in `roots`.
    If a zero has multiplicity n, then it must appear in `roots` n times.
    For instance, if 2 is a root of multiplicity three and 3 is a root of
    multiplicity 2, then `roots` looks something like [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]. The
    roots can appear in any order.

    If the returned coefficients are `c`, then

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * He_1(x) + ... +  c_n * He_n(x)

    The coefficient of the last term is not generally 1 for monic
    polynomials in HermiteE form.

    Parameters
    ----------
    roots : array_like
        Sequence containing the roots.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        1-D array of coefficients.  If all roots are real then `out` is a
        real array, if some of the roots are complex, then `out` is complex
        even if all the coefficients in the result are real (see Examples
        below).

    _normed_hermite_e_n
    Evaluate a 3-D Hermite_e series at points (x, y, z).

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(x,y,z) = \sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * He_i(x) * He_j(y) * He_k(z)

    The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are converted to arrays only if
    they are tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars and
    they must have the same shape after conversion. In either case, either
    `x`, `y`, and `z` or their elements must support multiplication and
    addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than 3 dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to its
    shape to make it 3-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[3:] +
    x.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible object
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points
        `(x, y, z)`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` must have the same shape.  If
        any of `x`, `y`, or `z` is a list or tuple, it is first converted
        to an ndarray, otherwise it is left unchanged and if it isn't an
        ndarray it is  treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term of
        multi-degree i,j,k is contained in ``c[i,j,k]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than 3 the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the multidimensional polynomial on points formed with
        triples of corresponding values from `x`, `y`, and `z`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    
    Differentiate a Hermite_e series.

    Returns the series coefficients `c` differentiated `m` times along
    `axis`.  At each iteration the result is multiplied by `scl` (the
    scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable). The argument
    `c` is an array of coefficients from low to high degree along each
    axis, e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series ``1*He_0 + 2*He_1 + 3*He_2``
    while [[1,2],[1,2]] represents ``1*He_0(x)*He_0(y) + 1*He_1(x)*He_0(y)
    + 2*He_0(x)*He_1(y) + 2*He_1(x)*He_1(y)`` if axis=0 is ``x`` and axis=1
    is ``y``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        Array of Hermite_e series coefficients. If `c` is multidimensional
        the different axis correspond to different variables with the
        degree in each axis given by the corresponding index.
    m : int, optional
        Number of derivatives taken, must be non-negative. (Default: 1)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Each differentiation is multiplied by `scl`.  The end result is
        multiplication by ``scl**m``.  This is for use in a linear change of
        variable. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the derivative is taken. (Default: 0).

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    der : ndarray
        Hermite series of the derivative.

    See Also
    --------
    hermeint

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the result of differentiating a Hermite series does not
    resemble the same operation on a power series. Thus the result of this
    function may be "unintuitive," albeit correct; see Examples section
    below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermeder
    >>> hermeder([ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])
    array([ 1.,  2.,  3.])
    >>> hermeder([-0.25,  1.,  1./2.,  1./3.,  1./4 ], m=2)
    array([ 1.,  2.,  3.])

    
    Evaluate a 2-D HermiteE series on the Cartesian product of x and y.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b) = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * H_i(a) * H_j(b)

    where the points `(a, b)` consist of all pairs formed by taking
    `a` from `x` and `b` from `y`. The resulting points form a grid with
    `x` in the first dimension and `y` in the second.

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In either
    case, either `x` and `y` or their elements must support multiplication
    and addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than two dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 2-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[2:] +
    x.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like, compatible objects
        The two dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x` and `y`.  If `x` or `y` is a list or
        tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is left
        unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree i,j are contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional polynomial at points in the Cartesian
        product of `x` and `y`.

    Parameters
    ----------

        The specified line is given by ``off + scl*x``.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        This module's representation of the Hermite series for
        ``off + scl*x``.

    See Also
    --------

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermeline

    >>> hermeval(0,hermeline(3, 2))
    3.0
    >>> hermeval(1,hermeline(3, 2))
    5.0

    Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degrees.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degrees `deg` and sample
    points `(x, y)`. The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., (deg[1] + 1)*i + j] = He_i(x) * He_j(y),

    where `0 <= i <= deg[0]` and `0 <= j <= deg[1]`. The leading indices of
    `V` index the points `(x, y)` and the last index encodes the degrees of
    the HermiteE polynomials.

    If ``V = hermevander2d(x, y, [xdeg, ydeg])``, then the columns of `V`
    correspond to the elements of a 2-D coefficient array `c` of shape
    (xdeg + 1, ydeg + 1) in the order

    .. math:: c_{00}, c_{01}, c_{02} ... , c_{10}, c_{11}, c_{12} ...

    and ``np.dot(V, c.flat)`` and ``hermeval2d(x, y, c)`` will be the same
    up to roundoff. This equivalence is useful both for least squares
    fitting and for the evaluation of a large number of 2-D HermiteE
    series of the same degrees and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        Arrays of point coordinates, all of the same shape. The dtypes
        will be converted to either float64 or complex128 depending on
        whether any of the elements are complex. Scalars are converted to
        1-D arrays.
    deg : list of ints
        List of maximum degrees of the form [x_deg, y_deg].

    Returns
    -------
    vander2d : ndarray
        The shape of the returned matrix is ``x.shape + (order,)``, where
        :math:`order = (deg[0]+1)*(deg([1]+1)`.  The dtype will be the same
        as the converted `x` and `y`.

    Compute the roots of a HermiteE series.

    Return the roots (a.k.a. "zeros") of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = \sum_i c[i] * He_i(x).

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : 1-D array_like
        1-D array of coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of the roots of the series. If all the roots are real,
        then `out` is also real, otherwise it is complex.

    See Also
    --------
    polyroots, legroots, lagroots, hermroots, chebroots

    Notes
    -----
    The root estimates are obtained as the eigenvalues of the companion
    matrix, Roots far from the origin of the complex plane may have large
    errors due to the numerical instability of the series for such
    values. Roots with multiplicity greater than 1 will also show larger
    errors as the value of the series near such points is relatively
    insensitive to errors in the roots. Isolated roots near the origin can
    be improved by a few iterations of Newton's method.

    The HermiteE series basis polynomials aren't powers of `x` so the
    results of this function may seem unintuitive.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermeroots, hermefromroots
    >>> coef = hermefromroots([-1, 0, 1])
    >>> coef
    array([ 0.,  2.,  0.,  1.])
    >>> hermeroots(coef)
    array([-1.,  0.,  1.])

    
    Return the scaled companion matrix of c.

    The basis polynomials are scaled so that the companion matrix is
    symmetric when `c` is an HermiteE basis polynomial. This provides
    better eigenvalue estimates than the unscaled case and for basis
    polynomials the eigenvalues are guaranteed to be real if
    `numpy.linalg.eigvalsh` is used to obtain them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of HermiteE series coefficients ordered from low to high
        degree.

    Returns
    -------
    mat : ndarray
        Scaled companion matrix of dimensions (deg, deg).

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    
    Subtract one Hermite series from another.

    Returns the difference of two Hermite series `c1` - `c2`.  The
    sequences of coefficients are from lowest order term to highest, i.e.,
    [1,2,3] represents the series ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Of Hermite series coefficients representing their difference.

    See Also
    --------
    hermeadd, hermemulx, hermemul, hermediv, hermepow

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the difference of two Hermite
    series is a Hermite series (without having to "reproject" the result
    onto the basis set) so subtraction, just like that of "standard"
    polynomials, is simply "component-wise."

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermesub
    >>> hermesub([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3])
    array([ 0.,  0.,  0.,  4.])

    Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degrees.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degrees `deg` and sample
    points `(x, y, z)`. If `l, m, n` are the given degrees in `x, y, z`,
    then Hehe pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., (m+1)(n+1)i + (n+1)j + k] = He_i(x)*He_j(y)*He_k(z),

    where `0 <= i <= l`, `0 <= j <= m`, and `0 <= j <= n`.  The leading
    indices of `V` index the points `(x, y, z)` and the last index encodes
    the degrees of the HermiteE polynomials.

    If ``V = hermevander3d(x, y, z, [xdeg, ydeg, zdeg])``, then the columns
    of `V` correspond to the elements of a 3-D coefficient array `c` of
    shape (xdeg + 1, ydeg + 1, zdeg + 1) in the order

    .. math:: c_{000}, c_{001}, c_{002},... , c_{010}, c_{011}, c_{012},...

    and  ``np.dot(V, c.flat)`` and ``hermeval3d(x, y, z, c)`` will be the
    same up to roundoff. This equivalence is useful both for least squares
    fitting and for the evaluation of a large number of 3-D HermiteE
    series of the same degrees and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like
        Arrays of point coordinates, all of the same shape. The dtypes will
        be converted to either float64 or complex128 depending on whether
        any of the elements are complex. Scalars are converted to 1-D
        arrays.
    deg : list of ints
        List of maximum degrees of the form [x_deg, y_deg, z_deg].

    Returns
    -------
    vander3d : ndarray
        The shape of the returned matrix is ``x.shape + (order,)``, where
        :math:`order = (deg[0]+1)*(deg([1]+1)*(deg[2]+1)`.  The dtype will
        be the same as the converted `x`, `y`, and `z`.

    Multiply one Hermite series by another.

    Returns the product of two Hermite series `c1` * `c2`.  The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients, from lowest order "term" to highest,
    e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Of Hermite series coefficients representing their product.

    See Also
    --------
    hermeadd, hermesub, hermemulx, hermediv, hermepow

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the (polynomial) product of two C-series results in terms
    that are not in the Hermite polynomial basis set.  Thus, to express
    the product as a Hermite series, it is necessary to "reproject" the
    product onto said basis set, which may produce "unintuitive" (but
    correct) results; see Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermemul
    >>> hermemul([1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2])
    array([ 14.,  15.,  28.,   7.,   6.])

    
    Evaluate a 2-D HermiteE series at points (x, y).

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(x,y) = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * He_i(x) * He_j(y)

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars and they
    must have the same shape after conversion. In either case, either `x`
    and `y` or their elements must support multiplication and addition both
    with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` is a 1-D array a one is implicitly appended to its shape to make
    it 2-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[2:] + x.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like, compatible objects
        The two dimensional series is evaluated at the points `(x, y)`,
        where `x` and `y` must have the same shape. If `x` or `y` is a list
        or tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is left
        unchanged and if it isn't an ndarray it is treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term
        of multi-degree i,j is contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has
        dimension greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple
        sets of coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional polynomial at points formed with
        pairs of corresponding values from `x` and `y`.

Objects for dealing with Laguerre series.

This module provides a number of objects (mostly functions) useful for
dealing with Laguerre series, including a `Laguerre` class that
encapsulates the usual arithmetic operations.  (General information
on how this module represents and works with such polynomials is in the
docstring for its "parent" sub-package, `numpy.polynomial`).

Constants
---------
- `lagdomain` -- Laguerre series default domain, [-1,1].
- `lagzero` -- Laguerre series that evaluates identically to 0.
- `lagone` -- Laguerre series that evaluates identically to 1.
- `lagx` -- Laguerre series for the identity map, ``f(x) = x``.

Arithmetic
----------
- `lagadd` -- add two Laguerre series.
- `lagsub` -- subtract one Laguerre series from another.
- `lagmulx` -- multiply a Laguerre series in ``P_i(x)`` by ``x``.

    Divide one Laguerre series by another.

    Returns the quotient-with-remainder of two Laguerre series
    `c1` / `c2`.  The arguments are sequences of coefficients from lowest
    order "term" to highest, e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series
    ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Laguerre series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    [quo, rem] : ndarrays
        Of Laguerre series coefficients representing the quotient and
        remainder.

    See Also
    --------
    lagadd, lagsub, lagmulx, lagmul, lagpow

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the (polynomial) division of one Laguerre series by another
    results in quotient and remainder terms that are not in the Laguerre
    polynomial basis set.  Thus, to express these results as a Laguerre
    series, it is necessary to "reproject" the results onto the Laguerre
    basis set, which may produce "unintuitive" (but correct) results; see
    Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagdiv
    >>> lagdiv([  8., -13.,  38., -51.,  36.], [0, 1, 2])
    (array([ 1.,  2.,  3.]), array([ 0.]))
    >>> lagdiv([  9., -12.,  38., -51.,  36.], [0, 1, 2])
    (array([ 1.,  2.,  3.]), array([ 1.,  1.]))

    Raise a Laguerre series to a power.

    Returns the Laguerre series `c` raised to the power `pow`. The
    argument `c` is a sequence of coefficients ordered from low to high.
    i.e., [1,2,3] is the series  ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2.``

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of Laguerre series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.
    pow : integer
        Power to which the series will be raised
    maxpower : integer, optional
        Maximum power allowed. This is mainly to limit growth of the series
        to unmanageable size. Default is 16

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray
        Laguerre series of power.

    See Also
    --------
    lagadd, lagsub, lagmulx, lagmul, lagdiv

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagpow
    >>> lagpow([1, 2, 3], 2)
    array([ 14., -16.,  56., -72.,  54.])

    
    Compute the roots of a Laguerre series.

    Return the roots (a.k.a. "zeros") of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = \sum_i c[i] * L_i(x).

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : 1-D array_like
        1-D array of coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of the roots of the series. If all the roots are real,
        then `out` is also real, otherwise it is complex.

    See Also
    --------
    polyroots, legroots, chebroots, hermroots, hermeroots

    Notes
    -----
    The root estimates are obtained as the eigenvalues of the companion
    matrix, Roots far from the origin of the complex plane may have large
    errors due to the numerical instability of the series for such
    values. Roots with multiplicity greater than 1 will also show larger
    errors as the value of the series near such points is relatively
    insensitive to errors in the roots. Isolated roots near the origin can
    be improved by a few iterations of Newton's method.

    The Laguerre series basis polynomials aren't powers of `x` so the
    results of this function may seem unintuitive.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagroots, lagfromroots
    >>> coef = lagfromroots([0, 1, 2])
    >>> coef
    array([  2.,  -8.,  12.,  -6.])
    >>> lagroots(coef)
    array([ -4.44089210e-16,   1.00000000e+00,   2.00000000e+00])

    Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degree.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degree `deg` and sample points
    `x`. The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., i] = L_i(x)

    where `0 <= i <= deg`. The leading indices of `V` index the elements of
    `x` and the last index is the degree of the Laguerre polynomial.

    If `c` is a 1-D array of coefficients of length `n + 1` and `V` is the
    array ``V = lagvander(x, n)``, then ``np.dot(V, c)`` and
    ``lagval(x, c)`` are the same up to roundoff. This equivalence is
    useful both for least squares fitting and for the evaluation of a large
    number of Laguerre series of the same degree and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Array of points. The dtype is converted to float64 or complex128
        depending on whether any of the elements are complex. If `x` is
        scalar it is converted to a 1-D array.
    deg : int
        Degree of the resulting matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    vander : ndarray
        The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix. The shape of the returned matrix is
        ``x.shape + (deg + 1,)``, where The last index is the degree of the
        corresponding Laguerre polynomial.  The dtype will be the same as
        the converted `x`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagvander
    >>> x = np.array([0, 1, 2])
    >>> lagvander(x, 3)
    array([[ 1.        ,  1.        ,  1.        ,  1.        ],
           [ 1.        ,  0.        , -0.5       , -0.66666667],
           [ 1.        , -1.        , -1.        , -0.33333333]])

    
    Return the companion matrix of c.

    The usual companion matrix of the Laguerre polynomials is already
    symmetric when `c` is a basis Laguerre polynomial, so no scaling is
    applied.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of Laguerre series coefficients ordered from low to high
        degree.

    Returns
    -------
    mat : ndarray
        Companion matrix of dimensions (deg, deg).

    Gauss-Laguerre quadrature.

    Computes the sample points and weights for Gauss-Laguerre quadrature.
    These sample points and weights will correctly integrate polynomials of
    degree :math:`2*deg - 1` or less over the interval :math:`[0, \inf]`
    with the weight function :math:`f(x) = \exp(-x)`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    deg : int
        Number of sample points and weights. It must be >= 1.

    Returns
    -------
    x : ndarray
        1-D ndarray containing the sample points.
    y : ndarray
        1-D ndarray containing the weights.

    Notes
    -----

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    The results have only been tested up to degree 100 higher degrees may
    be problematic. The weights are determined by using the fact that

    .. math:: w_k = c / (L'_n(x_k) * L_{n-1}(x_k))

    where :math:`c` is a constant independent of :math:`k` and :math:`x_k`
    is the k'th root of :math:`L_n`, and then scaling the results to get
    the right value when integrating 1.

    Weight function of the Laguerre polynomials.

    The weight function is :math:`exp(-x)` and the interval of integration
    is :math:`[0, \inf]`. The Laguerre polynomials are orthogonal, but not
    normalized, with respect to this weight function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
       Values at which the weight function will be computed.

    Returns
    -------
    w : ndarray
       The weight function at `x`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    
    Evaluate a 3-D Laguerre series at points (x, y, z).

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(x,y,z) = \sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * L_i(x) * L_j(y) * L_k(z)

    The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are converted to arrays only if
    they are tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars and
    they must have the same shape after conversion. In either case, either
    `x`, `y`, and `z` or their elements must support multiplication and
    addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than 3 dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to its
    shape to make it 3-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[3:] +
    x.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible object
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points
        `(x, y, z)`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` must have the same shape.  If
        any of `x`, `y`, or `z` is a list or tuple, it is first converted
        to an ndarray, otherwise it is left unchanged and if it isn't an
        ndarray it is  treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term of
        multi-degree i,j,k is contained in ``c[i,j,k]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than 3 the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the multidimension polynomial on points formed with
        triples of corresponding values from `x`, `y`, and `z`.

    Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degrees.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degrees `deg` and sample
    points `(x, y, z)`. If `l, m, n` are the given degrees in `x, y, z`,
    then The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., (m+1)(n+1)i + (n+1)j + k] = L_i(x)*L_j(y)*L_k(z),

    where `0 <= i <= l`, `0 <= j <= m`, and `0 <= j <= n`.  The leading
    indices of `V` index the points `(x, y, z)` and the last index encodes
    the degrees of the Laguerre polynomials.

    If ``V = lagvander3d(x, y, z, [xdeg, ydeg, zdeg])``, then the columns
    of `V` correspond to the elements of a 3-D coefficient array `c` of
    shape (xdeg + 1, ydeg + 1, zdeg + 1) in the order

    .. math:: c_{000}, c_{001}, c_{002},... , c_{010}, c_{011}, c_{012},...

    and  ``np.dot(V, c.flat)`` and ``lagval3d(x, y, z, c)`` will be the
    same up to roundoff. This equivalence is useful both for least squares
    fitting and for the evaluation of a large number of 3-D Laguerre
    series of the same degrees and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like
        Arrays of point coordinates, all of the same shape. The dtypes will
        be converted to either float64 or complex128 depending on whether
        any of the elements are complex. Scalars are converted to 1-D
        arrays.
    deg : list of ints
        List of maximum degrees of the form [x_deg, y_deg, z_deg].

    Returns
    -------
    vander3d : ndarray
        The shape of the returned matrix is ``x.shape + (order,)``, where
        :math:`order = (deg[0]+1)*(deg([1]+1)*(deg[2]+1)`.  The dtype will
        be the same as the converted `x`, `y`, and `z`.

    A Laguerre series class.

    The Laguerre class provides the standard Python numerical methods
    '+', '-', '*', '//', '%', 'divmod', '**', and '()' as well as the
    attributes and methods listed in the `ABCPolyBase` documentation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coef : array_like
        Laguerre coefficients in order of increasing degree, i.e,
        ``(1, 2, 3)`` gives ``1*L_0(x) + 2*L_1(X) + 3*L_2(x)``.
    domain : (2,) array_like, optional
        Domain to use. The interval ``[domain[0], domain[1]]`` is mapped
        to the interval ``[window[0], window[1]]`` by shifting and scaling.
        The default value is [0, 1].
    window : (2,) array_like, optional
        Window, see `domain` for its use. The default value is [0, 1].

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    
    Generate a Laguerre series with given roots.

    The function returns the coefficients of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = (x - r_0) * (x - r_1) * ... * (x - r_n),

    in Laguerre form, where the `r_n` are the roots specified in `roots`.
    If a zero has multiplicity n, then it must appear in `roots` n times.
    For instance, if 2 is a root of multiplicity three and 3 is a root of
    multiplicity 2, then `roots` looks something like [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]. The
    roots can appear in any order.

    If the returned coefficients are `c`, then

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * L_1(x) + ... +  c_n * L_n(x)

    The coefficient of the last term is not generally 1 for monic
    polynomials in Laguerre form.

    Parameters
    ----------
    roots : array_like
        Sequence containing the roots.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        1-D array of coefficients.  If all roots are real then `out` is a
        real array, if some of the roots are complex, then `out` is complex
        even if all the coefficients in the result are real (see Examples
        below).

    See Also
    --------
    polyfromroots, legfromroots, chebfromroots, hermfromroots,
    hermefromroots.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagfromroots, lagval
    >>> coef = lagfromroots((-1, 0, 1))
    >>> lagval((-1, 0, 1), coef)
    array([ 0.,  0.,  0.])
    >>> coef = lagfromroots((-1j, 1j))
    >>> lagval((-1j, 1j), coef)
    array([ 0.+0.j,  0.+0.j])

    
    Evaluate a Laguerre series at points x.

    If `c` is of length `n + 1`, this function returns the value:

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 * L_0(x) + c_1 * L_1(x) + ... + c_n * L_n(x)

    The parameter `x` is converted to an array only if it is a tuple or a
    list, otherwise it is treated as a scalar. In either case, either `x`
    or its elements must support multiplication and addition both with
    themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` is a 1-D array, then `p(x)` will have the same shape as `x`.  If
    `c` is multidimensional, then the shape of the result depends on the
    value of `tensor`. If `tensor` is true the shape will be c.shape[1:] +
    x.shape. If `tensor` is false the shape will be c.shape[1:]. Note that
    scalars have shape (,).

    Trailing zeros in the coefficients will be used in the evaluation, so
    they should be avoided if efficiency is a concern.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, compatible object
        If `x` is a list or tuple, it is converted to an ndarray, otherwise
        it is left unchanged and treated as a scalar. In either case, `x`
        or its elements must support addition and multiplication with
        with themselves and with the elements of `c`.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree n are contained in c[n]. If `c` is multidimensional the
        remaining indices enumerate multiple polynomials. In the two
        dimensional case the coefficients may be thought of as stored in
        the columns of `c`.
    tensor : boolean, optional
        If True, the shape of the coefficient array is extended with ones
        on the right, one for each dimension of `x`. Scalars have dimension 0
        for this action. The result is that every column of coefficients in
        `c` is evaluated for every element of `x`. If False, `x` is broadcast
        over the columns of `c` for the evaluation.  This keyword is useful
        when `c` is multidimensional. The default value is True.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, algebra_like
        The shape of the return value is described above.

    See Also
    --------
    lagval2d, laggrid2d, lagval3d, laggrid3d

    Notes
    -----
    The evaluation uses Clenshaw recursion, aka synthetic division.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagval
    >>> coef = [1,2,3]
    >>> lagval(1, coef)
    -0.5
    >>> lagval([[1,2],[3,4]], coef)
    array([[-0.5, -4. ],
           [-4.5, -2. ]])

    Multiply a Laguerre series by x.

    Multiply the Laguerre series `c` by x, where x is the independent
    variable.


    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of Laguerre series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array representing the result of the multiplication.

    See Also
    --------
    lagadd, lagsub, lagmul, lagdiv, lagpow

    Notes
    -----
    The multiplication uses the recursion relationship for Laguerre
    polynomials in the form

    .. math::

    xP_i(x) = (-(i + 1)*P_{i + 1}(x) + (2i + 1)P_{i}(x) - iP_{i - 1}(x))

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagmulx
    >>> lagmulx([1, 2, 3])
    array([ -1.,  -1.,  11.,  -9.])

    <module numpy.polynomial.laguerre>
    Subtract one Laguerre series from another.

    Returns the difference of two Laguerre series `c1` - `c2`.  The
    sequences of coefficients are from lowest order term to highest, i.e.,
    [1,2,3] represents the series ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Laguerre series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Of Laguerre series coefficients representing their difference.

    See Also
    --------
    lagadd, lagmulx, lagmul, lagdiv, lagpow

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the difference of two Laguerre
    series is a Laguerre series (without having to "reproject" the result
    onto the basis set) so subtraction, just like that of "standard"
    polynomials, is simply "component-wise."

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagsub
    >>> lagsub([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3])
    array([ 0.,  0.,  0.,  4.])

    
    Laguerre series whose graph is a straight line.



    Parameters
    ----------
    off, scl : scalars
        The specified line is given by ``off + scl*x``.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        This module's representation of the Laguerre series for
        ``off + scl*x``.

    --------
    polyline, chebline

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagline, lagval

    3.0
    >>> lagval(1,lagline(3, 2))
    5.0

    
    Least squares fit of Laguerre series to data.

    Return the coefficients of a Laguerre series of degree `deg` that is the
    least squares fit to the data values `y` given at points `x`. If `y` is
    1-D the returned coefficients will also be 1-D. If `y` is 2-D multiple
    fits are done, one for each column of `y`, and the resulting
    coefficients are stored in the corresponding columns of a 2-D return.
    The fitted polynomial(s) are in the form

    .. math::  p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * L_1(x) + ... + c_n * L_n(x),

    where `n` is `deg`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (M,)
        x-coordinates of the M sample points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
    y : array_like, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        y-coordinates of the sample points. Several data sets of sample
        points sharing the same x-coordinates can be fitted at once by
        passing in a 2D-array that contains one dataset per column.
    deg : int or 1-D array_like
        Degree(s) of the fitting polynomials. If `deg` is a single integer
        all terms up to and including the `deg`'th term are included in the
        fit. For NumPy versions >= 1.11.0 a list of integers specifying the
        degrees of the terms to include may be used instead.
    rcond : float, optional
        Relative condition number of the fit. Singular values smaller than
        this relative to the largest singular value will be ignored. The
        default value is len(x)*eps, where eps is the relative precision of
        the float type, about 2e-16 in most cases.
    full : bool, optional
        Switch determining nature of return value. When it is False (the
        default) just the coefficients are returned, when True diagnostic
        information from the singular value decomposition is also returned.
    w : array_like, shape (`M`,), optional
        Weights. If not None, the contribution of each point
        ``(x[i],y[i])`` to the fit is weighted by `w[i]`. Ideally the
        weights are chosen so that the errors of the products ``w[i]*y[i]``
        all have the same variance.  The default value is None.

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        Laguerre coefficients ordered from low to high. If `y` was 2-D,
        the coefficients for the data in column k  of `y` are in column
        `k`.

    [residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond] : list
        These values are only returned if `full` = True

        resid -- sum of squared residuals of the least squares fit
        rank -- the numerical rank of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        sv -- singular values of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        rcond -- value of `rcond`.

        For more details, see `linalg.lstsq`.

    Warns
    -----
    RankWarning
        The rank of the coefficient matrix in the least-squares fit is
        deficient. The warning is only raised if `full` = False.  The
        warnings can be turned off by

        >>> import warnings
        >>> warnings.simplefilter('ignore', RankWarning)

    Notes
    -----
    The solution is the coefficients of the Laguerre series `p` that
    minimizes the sum of the weighted squared errors

    .. math:: E = \sum_j w_j^2 * |y_j - p(x_j)|^2,

    where the :math:`w_j` are the weights. This problem is solved by
    setting up as the (typically) overdetermined matrix equation

    .. math:: V(x) * c = w * y,

    where `V` is the weighted pseudo Vandermonde matrix of `x`, `c` are the
    coefficients to be solved for, `w` are the weights, and `y` are the
    observed values.  This equation is then solved using the singular value
    decomposition of `V`.

    If some of the singular values of `V` are so small that they are
    neglected, then a `RankWarning` will be issued. This means that the
    coefficient values may be poorly determined. Using a lower order fit
    will usually get rid of the warning.  The `rcond` parameter can also be
    set to a value smaller than its default, but the resulting fit may be
    spurious and have large contributions from roundoff error.

    Fits using Laguerre series are probably most useful when the data can
    be approximated by ``sqrt(w(x)) * p(x)``, where `w(x)` is the Laguerre
    weight. In that case the weight ``sqrt(w(x[i])`` should be used
    together with data values ``y[i]/sqrt(w(x[i])``. The weight function is
    available as `lagweight`.

    Add one Laguerre series to another.

    Returns the sum of two Laguerre series `c1` + `c2`.  The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients ordered from lowest order term to
    highest, i.e., [1,2,3] represents the series ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Laguerre series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array representing the Laguerre series of their sum.

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the sum of two Laguerre series
    is a Laguerre series (without having to "reproject" the result onto
    the basis set) so addition, just like that of "standard" polynomials,
    is simply "component-wise."

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagadd
    >>> lagadd([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4])
    array([ 2.,  4.,  6.,  4.])


    
    Evaluate a 2-D Laguerre series on the Cartesian product of x and y.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b) = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * L_i(a) * L_j(b)

    where the points `(a, b)` consist of all pairs formed by taking
    `a` from `x` and `b` from `y`. The resulting points form a grid with
    `x` in the first dimension and `y` in the second.

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In either
    case, either `x` and `y` or their elements must support multiplication
    and addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than two dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 2-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[2:] +
    x.shape + y.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like, compatible objects
        The two dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x` and `y`.  If `x` or `y` is a list or
        tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is left
        unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term of
        multi-degree i,j is contained in `c[i,j]`. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional Chebyshev series at points in the
        Cartesian product of `x` and `y`.

    Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degrees.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degrees `deg` and sample
    points `(x, y)`. The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., (deg[1] + 1)*i + j] = L_i(x) * L_j(y),

    where `0 <= i <= deg[0]` and `0 <= j <= deg[1]`. The leading indices of
    `V` index the points `(x, y)` and the last index encodes the degrees of
    the Laguerre polynomials.

    If ``V = lagvander2d(x, y, [xdeg, ydeg])``, then the columns of `V`
    correspond to the elements of a 2-D coefficient array `c` of shape
    (xdeg + 1, ydeg + 1) in the order

    .. math:: c_{00}, c_{01}, c_{02} ... , c_{10}, c_{11}, c_{12} ...

    and ``np.dot(V, c.flat)`` and ``lagval2d(x, y, c)`` will be the same
    up to roundoff. This equivalence is useful both for least squares
    fitting and for the evaluation of a large number of 2-D Laguerre
    series of the same degrees and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        Arrays of point coordinates, all of the same shape. The dtypes
        will be converted to either float64 or complex128 depending on
        whether any of the elements are complex. Scalars are converted to
        1-D arrays.
    deg : list of ints
        List of maximum degrees of the form [x_deg, y_deg].

    Returns
    -------
    vander2d : ndarray
        The shape of the returned matrix is ``x.shape + (order,)``, where
        :math:`order = (deg[0]+1)*(deg([1]+1)`.  The dtype will be the same
        as the converted `x` and `y`.

    Evaluate a 2-D Laguerre series at points (x, y).

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(x,y) = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * L_i(x) * L_j(y)

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars and they
    must have the same shape after conversion. In either case, either `x`
    and `y` or their elements must support multiplication and addition both
    with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` is a 1-D array a one is implicitly appended to its shape to make
    it 2-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[2:] + x.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like, compatible objects
        The two dimensional series is evaluated at the points `(x, y)`,
        where `x` and `y` must have the same shape. If `x` or `y` is a list
        or tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is left
        unchanged and if it isn't an ndarray it is treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term
        of multi-degree i,j is contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has
        dimension greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple
        sets of coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional polynomial at points formed with
        pairs of corresponding values from `x` and `y`.

    Convert a Laguerre series to a polynomial.

    Convert an array representing the coefficients of a Laguerre series,
    ordered from lowest degree to highest, to an array of the coefficients
    of the equivalent polynomial (relative to the "standard" basis) ordered
    from lowest to highest degree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array containing the Laguerre series coefficients, ordered
        from lowest order term to highest.

    Returns
    -------
    pol : ndarray
        1-D array containing the coefficients of the equivalent polynomial

    /home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/polynomial/laguerre.py
    Multiply one Laguerre series by another.

    Returns the product of two Laguerre series `c1` * `c2`.  The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients, from lowest order "term" to highest,
    e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Laguerre series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Of Laguerre series coefficients representing their product.

    --------
    lagadd, lagsub, lagmulx, lagdiv, lagpow

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the (polynomial) product of two C-series results in terms
    that are not in the Laguerre polynomial basis set.  Thus, to express
    the product as a Laguerre series, it is necessary to "reproject" the
    product onto said basis set, which may produce "unintuitive" (but
    correct) results; see Examples section below.

    Evaluate a 3-D Laguerre series on the Cartesian product of x, y, and z.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b,c) = \sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * L_i(a) * L_j(b) * L_k(c)

    where the points `(a, b, c)` consist of all triples formed by taking
    `a` from `x`, `b` from `y`, and `c` from `z`. The resulting points form
    a grid with `x` in the first dimension, `y` in the second, and `z` in
    the third.

    The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are converted to arrays only if they
    are tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In
    either case, either `x`, `y`, and `z` or their elements must support
    multiplication and addition both with themselves and with the elements
    of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than three dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 3-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[3:] +
    x.shape + y.shape + z.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible objects
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x`, `y`, and `z`.  If `x`,`y`, or `z` is a
        list or tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is
        left unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a
        scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree i,j are contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional polynomial at points in the Cartesian
        product of `x` and `y`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    
    Differentiate a Laguerre series.

    Returns the Laguerre series coefficients `c` differentiated `m` times
    along `axis`.  At each iteration the result is multiplied by `scl` (the
    scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable). The argument
    `c` is an array of coefficients from low to high degree along each
    axis, e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series ``1*L_0 + 2*L_1 + 3*L_2``
    while [[1,2],[1,2]] represents ``1*L_0(x)*L_0(y) + 1*L_1(x)*L_0(y) +
    2*L_0(x)*L_1(y) + 2*L_1(x)*L_1(y)`` if axis=0 is ``x`` and axis=1 is
    ``y``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        Array of Laguerre series coefficients. If `c` is multidimensional
        the different axis correspond to different variables with the
        degree in each axis given by the corresponding index.
    m : int, optional
        Number of derivatives taken, must be non-negative. (Default: 1)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Each differentiation is multiplied by `scl`.  The end result is
        multiplication by ``scl**m``.  This is for use in a linear change of
        variable. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the derivative is taken. (Default: 0).

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    der : ndarray
        Laguerre series of the derivative.

    See Also
    --------
    lagint

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the result of differentiating a Laguerre series does not
    resemble the same operation on a power series. Thus the result of this
    function may be "unintuitive," albeit correct; see Examples section
    below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagder
    >>> lagder([ 1.,  1.,  1., -3.])
    array([ 1.,  2.,  3.])
    >>> lagder([ 1.,  0.,  0., -4.,  3.], m=2)

    poly2lag(pol)

    Convert a polynomial to a Laguerre series.

    Convert an array representing the coefficients of a polynomial (relative
    to the "standard" basis) ordered from lowest degree to highest, to an
    array of the coefficients of the equivalent Laguerre series, ordered
    from lowest to highest degree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pol : array_like
        1-D array containing the polynomial coefficients

    Returns
    -------
    c : ndarray
        1-D array containing the coefficients of the equivalent Laguerre
        series.

    See Also
    --------
    lag2poly

    Notes
    -----
    The easy way to do conversions between polynomial basis sets
    is to use the convert method of a class instance.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import poly2lag
    >>> poly2lag(np.arange(4))
    array([ 23., -63.,  58., -18.])

    
    Integrate a Laguerre series.

    Returns the Laguerre series coefficients `c` integrated `m` times from
    `lbnd` along `axis`. At each iteration the resulting series is
    **multiplied** by `scl` and an integration constant, `k`, is added.
    The scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable.  ("Buyer
    beware": note that, depending on what one is doing, one may want `scl`
    to be the reciprocal of what one might expect; for more information,
    see the Notes section below.)  The argument `c` is an array of
    coefficients from low to high degree along each axis, e.g., [1,2,3]
    represents the series ``L_0 + 2*L_1 + 3*L_2`` while [[1,2],[1,2]]
    represents ``1*L_0(x)*L_0(y) + 1*L_1(x)*L_0(y) + 2*L_0(x)*L_1(y) +
    2*L_1(x)*L_1(y)`` if axis=0 is ``x`` and axis=1 is ``y``.


    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        Array of Laguerre series coefficients. If `c` is multidimensional
        the different axis correspond to different variables with the
        degree in each axis given by the corresponding index.
    m : int, optional
        Order of integration, must be positive. (Default: 1)
    k : {[], list, scalar}, optional
        Integration constant(s).  The value of the first integral at
        ``lbnd`` is the first value in the list, the value of the second
        integral at ``lbnd`` is the second value, etc.  If ``k == []`` (the
        default), all constants are set to zero.  If ``m == 1``, a single
        scalar can be given instead of a list.
    lbnd : scalar, optional
        The lower bound of the integral. (Default: 0)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Following each integration the result is *multiplied* by `scl`
        before the integration constant is added. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the integral is taken. (Default: 0).

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    S : ndarray
        Laguerre series coefficients of the integral.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``m < 0``, ``len(k) > m``, ``np.ndim(lbnd) != 0``, or
        ``np.ndim(scl) != 0``.

    See Also
    --------
    lagder

    Notes
    -----
    Note that the result of each integration is *multiplied* by `scl`.
    Why is this important to note?  Say one is making a linear change of
    variable :math:`u = ax + b` in an integral relative to `x`.  Then
    :math:`dx = du/a`, so one will need to set `scl` equal to
    :math:`1/a` - perhaps not what one would have first thought.

    Also note that, in general, the result of integrating a C-series needs
    to be "reprojected" onto the C-series basis set.  Thus, typically,
    the result of this function is "unintuitive," albeit correct; see
    Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagint
    >>> lagint([1,2,3])
    array([ 1.,  1.,  1., -3.])
    >>> lagint([1,2,3], m=2)
    array([ 1.,  0.,  0., -4.,  3.])
    >>> lagint([1,2,3], k=1)

    Add one Legendre series to another.

    Returns the sum of two Legendre series `c1` + `c2`.  The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients ordered from lowest order term to
    highest, i.e., [1,2,3] represents the series ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Legendre series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array representing the Legendre series of their sum.

    See Also
    --------
    legsub, legmulx, legmul, legdiv, legpow

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the sum of two Legendre series
    is a Legendre series (without having to "reproject" the result onto
    the basis set) so addition, just like that of "standard" polynomials,
    is simply "component-wise."

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import legendre as L
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> L.legadd(c1,c2)
    array([ 4.,  4.,  4.])

    legvallegline
    Least squares fit of Legendre series to data.

    Return the coefficients of a Legendre series of degree `deg` that is the
    least squares fit to the data values `y` given at points `x`. If `y` is
    1-D the returned coefficients will also be 1-D. If `y` is 2-D multiple
    fits are done, one for each column of `y`, and the resulting
    coefficients are stored in the corresponding columns of a 2-D return.
    The fitted polynomial(s) are in the form

    .. math::  p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * L_1(x) + ... + c_n * L_n(x),

    where `n` is `deg`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (M,)
        x-coordinates of the M sample points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
    y : array_like, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        y-coordinates of the sample points. Several data sets of sample
        points sharing the same x-coordinates can be fitted at once by
        passing in a 2D-array that contains one dataset per column.
    deg : int or 1-D array_like
        Degree(s) of the fitting polynomials. If `deg` is a single integer
        all terms up to and including the `deg`'th term are included in the
        fit. For NumPy versions >= 1.11.0 a list of integers specifying the
        degrees of the terms to include may be used instead.
    rcond : float, optional
        Relative condition number of the fit. Singular values smaller than
        this relative to the largest singular value will be ignored. The
        default value is len(x)*eps, where eps is the relative precision of
        the float type, about 2e-16 in most cases.
    full : bool, optional
        Switch determining nature of return value. When it is False (the
        default) just the coefficients are returned, when True diagnostic
        information from the singular value decomposition is also returned.
    w : array_like, shape (`M`,), optional
        Weights. If not None, the contribution of each point
        ``(x[i],y[i])`` to the fit is weighted by `w[i]`. Ideally the
        weights are chosen so that the errors of the products ``w[i]*y[i]``
        all have the same variance.  The default value is None.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        Legendre coefficients ordered from low to high. If `y` was
        2-D, the coefficients for the data in column k of `y` are in
        column `k`. If `deg` is specified as a list, coefficients for
        terms not included in the fit are set equal to zero in the
        returned `coef`.

    [residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond] : list
        These values are only returned if `full` = True

        resid -- sum of squared residuals of the least squares fit
        rank -- the numerical rank of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        sv -- singular values of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        rcond -- value of `rcond`.

        For more details, see `linalg.lstsq`.

    Warns
    -----
    RankWarning
        The rank of the coefficient matrix in the least-squares fit is
        deficient. The warning is only raised if `full` = False.  The
        warnings can be turned off by

        >>> import warnings
        >>> warnings.simplefilter('ignore', RankWarning)

    linalg.lstsq : Computes a least-squares fit from the matrix.
    scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline : Computes spline fits.

    Notes
    -----
    The solution is the coefficients of the Legendre series `p` that
    minimizes the sum of the weighted squared errors

    .. math:: E = \sum_j w_j^2 * |y_j - p(x_j)|^2,

    where :math:`w_j` are the weights. This problem is solved by setting up
    as the (typically) overdetermined matrix equation

    .. math:: V(x) * c = w * y,

    where `V` is the weighted pseudo Vandermonde matrix of `x`, `c` are the
    coefficients to be solved for, `w` are the weights, and `y` are the
    observed values.  This equation is then solved using the singular value
    decomposition of `V`.

    If some of the singular values of `V` are so small that they are
    neglected, then a `RankWarning` will be issued. This means that the
    coefficient values may be poorly determined. Using a lower order fit
    will usually get rid of the warning.  The `rcond` parameter can also be
    set to a value smaller than its default, but the resulting fit may be
    spurious and have large contributions from roundoff error.

    Fits using Legendre series are usually better conditioned than fits
    using power series, but much can depend on the distribution of the
    sample points and the smoothness of the data. If the quality of the fit
    is inadequate splines may be a good alternative.

    Examples
    --------

    legvander2dPseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degrees.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degrees `deg` and sample
    points `(x, y)`. The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., (deg[1] + 1)*i + j] = L_i(x) * L_j(y),

    where `0 <= i <= deg[0]` and `0 <= j <= deg[1]`. The leading indices of
    `V` index the points `(x, y)` and the last index encodes the degrees of
    the Legendre polynomials.

    If ``V = legvander2d(x, y, [xdeg, ydeg])``, then the columns of `V`
    correspond to the elements of a 2-D coefficient array `c` of shape
    (xdeg + 1, ydeg + 1) in the order

    .. math:: c_{00}, c_{01}, c_{02} ... , c_{10}, c_{11}, c_{12} ...

    and ``np.dot(V, c.flat)`` and ``legval2d(x, y, c)`` will be the same
    up to roundoff. This equivalence is useful both for least squares
    fitting and for the evaluation of a large number of 2-D Legendre
    series of the same degrees and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        Arrays of point coordinates, all of the same shape. The dtypes
        will be converted to either float64 or complex128 depending on
        whether any of the elements are complex. Scalars are converted to
        1-D arrays.
    deg : list of ints
        List of maximum degrees of the form [x_deg, y_deg].

    Returns
    -------
    vander2d : ndarray
        The shape of the returned matrix is ``x.shape + (order,)``, where
        :math:`order = (deg[0]+1)*(deg([1]+1)`.  The dtype will be the same
        as the converted `x` and `y`.

    Multiply one Legendre series by another.

    Returns the product of two Legendre series `c1` * `c2`.  The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients, from lowest order "term" to highest,
    e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Legendre series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Of Legendre series coefficients representing their product.

    See Also
    --------
    legadd, legsub, legmulx, legdiv, legpow

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the (polynomial) product of two C-series results in terms
    that are not in the Legendre polynomial basis set.  Thus, to express
    the product as a Legendre series, it is necessary to "reproject" the
    product onto said basis set, which may produce "unintuitive" (but
    correct) results; see Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import legendre as L
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2)
    >>> P.legmul(c1,c2) # multiplication requires "reprojection"
    array([  4.33333333,  10.4       ,  11.66666667,   3.6       ])

    Raise a Legendre series to a power.

    Returns the Legendre series `c` raised to the power `pow`. The
    argument `c` is a sequence of coefficients ordered from low to high.
    i.e., [1,2,3] is the series  ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2.``

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of Legendre series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.
    pow : integer
        Power to which the series will be raised
    maxpower : integer, optional
        Maximum power allowed. This is mainly to limit growth of the series
        to unmanageable size. Default is 16

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray
        Legendre series of power.

    See Also
    --------
    legadd, legsub, legmulx, legmul, legdiv

    Examples
    --------

    
    Legendre series whose graph is a straight line.



    Parameters
    ----------
    off, scl : scalars
        The specified line is given by ``off + scl*x``.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        This module's representation of the Legendre series for
        ``off + scl*x``.

    Examples

    >>> L.legline(3,2)
    array([3, 2])
    >>> L.legval(-3, L.legline(3,2)) # should be -3
    -3.0

    
    Weight function of the Legendre polynomials.

    The weight function is :math:`1` and the interval of integration is
    :math:`[-1, 1]`. The Legendre polynomials are orthogonal, but not
    normalized, with respect to this weight function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
       Values at which the weight function will be computed.

    Returns
    -------
    w : ndarray
       The weight function at `x`.

    Notes
    -----

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    
    Divide one Legendre series by another.

    Returns the quotient-with-remainder of two Legendre series
    `c1` / `c2`.  The arguments are sequences of coefficients from lowest
    order "term" to highest, e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series
    ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Legendre series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    quo, rem : ndarrays
        Of Legendre series coefficients representing the quotient and
        remainder.

    See Also
    --------
    legadd, legsub, legmulx, legmul, legpow

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the (polynomial) division of one Legendre series by another
    results in quotient and remainder terms that are not in the Legendre
    polynomial basis set.  Thus, to express these results as a Legendre
    series, it is necessary to "reproject" the results onto the Legendre
    basis set, which may produce "unintuitive" (but correct) results; see
    Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import legendre as L
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> L.legdiv(c1,c2) # quotient "intuitive," remainder not
    (array([ 3.]), array([-8., -4.]))
    >>> c2 = (0,1,2,3)
    >>> L.legdiv(c2,c1) # neither "intuitive"
    (array([-0.07407407,  1.66666667]), array([-1.03703704, -2.51851852]))

    
    Convert a Legendre series to a polynomial.

    Convert an array representing the coefficients of a Legendre series,
    ordered from lowest degree to highest, to an array of the coefficients
    of the equivalent polynomial (relative to the "standard" basis) ordered
    from lowest to highest degree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array containing the Legendre series coefficients, ordered
        from lowest order term to highest.

    Returns
    -------
    pol : ndarray
        1-D array containing the coefficients of the equivalent polynomial
        (relative to the "standard" basis) ordered from lowest order term
        to highest.

    See Also
    --------
    poly2leg

    Notes
    -----
    The easy way to do conversions between polynomial basis sets
    is to use the convert method of a class instance.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> c = P.Legendre(range(4))
    >>> c
    Legendre([ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.], [-1.,  1.])
    >>> p = c.convert(kind=P.Polynomial)
    >>> p
    Polynomial([-1. , -3.5,  3. ,  7.5], [-1.,  1.])
    >>> P.leg2poly(range(4))
    array([-1. , -3.5,  3. ,  7.5])


    
    Convert a polynomial to a Legendre series.

    Convert an array representing the coefficients of a polynomial (relative
    to the "standard" basis) ordered from lowest degree to highest, to an
    array of the coefficients of the equivalent Legendre series, ordered
    from lowest to highest degree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pol : array_like
        1-D array containing the polynomial coefficients

    Returns
    -------
    c : ndarray
        1-D array containing the coefficients of the equivalent Legendre
        series.

    See Also
    --------
    leg2poly

    Notes
    -----
    The easy way to do conversions between polynomial basis sets
    is to use the convert method of a class instance.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy import polynomial as P
    >>> p = P.Polynomial(np.arange(4))
    >>> p
    Polynomial([ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.], domain=[-1,  1], window=[-1,  1])
    >>> c = P.Legendre(P.legendre.poly2leg(p.coef))
    >>> c
    Legendre([ 1.  ,  3.25,  1.  ,  0.75], domain=[-1,  1], window=[-1,  1])

    
    Subtract one Legendre series from another.

    Returns the difference of two Legendre series `c1` - `c2`.  The
    sequences of coefficients are from lowest order term to highest, i.e.,
    [1,2,3] represents the series ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Legendre series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Of Legendre series coefficients representing their difference.

    See Also
    --------
    legadd, legmulx, legmul, legdiv, legpow

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the difference of two Legendre
    series is a Legendre series (without having to "reproject" the result
    onto the basis set) so subtraction, just like that of "standard"
    polynomials, is simply "component-wise."

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import legendre as L
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> L.legsub(c1,c2)
    array([-2.,  0.,  2.])
    >>> L.legsub(c2,c1) # -C.legsub(c1,c2)
    array([ 2.,  0., -2.])

    Multiply a Legendre series by x.

    Multiply the Legendre series `c` by x, where x is the independent
    variable.


    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of Legendre series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array representing the result of the multiplication.

    See Also
    --------
    legadd, legmul, legmul, legdiv, legpow

    Notes
    -----
    The multiplication uses the recursion relationship for Legendre
    polynomials in the form

    .. math::

      xP_i(x) = ((i + 1)*P_{i + 1}(x) + i*P_{i - 1}(x))/(2i + 1)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import legendre as L
    >>> L.legmulx([1,2,3])
    array([ 0.66666667, 2.2, 1.33333333, 1.8])

    
    Differentiate a Legendre series.

    Returns the Legendre series coefficients `c` differentiated `m` times
    along `axis`.  At each iteration the result is multiplied by `scl` (the
    scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable). The argument
    `c` is an array of coefficients from low to high degree along each
    axis, e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series ``1*L_0 + 2*L_1 + 3*L_2``
    while [[1,2],[1,2]] represents ``1*L_0(x)*L_0(y) + 1*L_1(x)*L_0(y) +
    2*L_0(x)*L_1(y) + 2*L_1(x)*L_1(y)`` if axis=0 is ``x`` and axis=1 is
    ``y``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        Array of Legendre series coefficients. If c is multidimensional the
        different axis correspond to different variables with the degree in
        each axis given by the corresponding index.
    m : int, optional
        Number of derivatives taken, must be non-negative. (Default: 1)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Each differentiation is multiplied by `scl`.  The end result is
        multiplication by ``scl**m``.  This is for use in a linear change of
        variable. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the derivative is taken. (Default: 0).

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    der : ndarray
        Legendre series of the derivative.

    See Also
    --------
    legint

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the result of differentiating a Legendre series does not
    resemble the same operation on a power series. Thus the result of this
    function may be "unintuitive," albeit correct; see Examples section
    below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import legendre as L
    >>> c = (1,2,3,4)
    >>> L.legder(c)
    array([  6.,   9.,  20.])
    >>> L.legder(c, 3)
    array([ 60.])
    >>> L.legder(c, scl=-1)
    array([ -6.,  -9., -20.])
    >>> L.legder(c, 2,-1)
    array([  9.,  60.])

    <module numpy.polynomial.legendre>Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degree.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degree `deg` and sample points
    `x`. The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., i] = L_i(x)

    where `0 <= i <= deg`. The leading indices of `V` index the elements of
    `x` and the last index is the degree of the Legendre polynomial.

    If `c` is a 1-D array of coefficients of length `n + 1` and `V` is the
    array ``V = legvander(x, n)``, then ``np.dot(V, c)`` and
    ``legval(x, c)`` are the same up to roundoff. This equivalence is
    useful both for least squares fitting and for the evaluation of a large
    number of Legendre series of the same degree and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Array of points. The dtype is converted to float64 or complex128
        depending on whether any of the elements are complex. If `x` is
        scalar it is converted to a 1-D array.
    deg : int
        Degree of the resulting matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    vander : ndarray
        The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix. The shape of the returned matrix is
        ``x.shape + (deg + 1,)``, where The last index is the degree of the
        corresponding Legendre polynomial.  The dtype will be the same as
        the converted `x`.

    Return the scaled companion matrix of c.

    The basis polynomials are scaled so that the companion matrix is
    symmetric when `c` is an Legendre basis polynomial. This provides
    better eigenvalue estimates than the unscaled case and for basis
    polynomials the eigenvalues are guaranteed to be real if
    `numpy.linalg.eigvalsh` is used to obtain them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of Legendre series coefficients ordered from low to high
        degree.

    Returns
    -------
    mat : ndarray
        Scaled companion matrix of dimensions (deg, deg).

    Gauss-Legendre quadrature.

    Computes the sample points and weights for Gauss-Legendre quadrature.
    These sample points and weights will correctly integrate polynomials of
    degree :math:`2*deg - 1` or less over the interval :math:`[-1, 1]` with
    the weight function :math:`f(x) = 1`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    deg : int
        Number of sample points and weights. It must be >= 1.

    Returns
    -------
    x : ndarray
        1-D ndarray containing the sample points.
    y : ndarray
        1-D ndarray containing the weights.

    Notes
    -----

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    The results have only been tested up to degree 100, higher degrees may
    be problematic. The weights are determined by using the fact that

    .. math:: w_k = c / (L'_n(x_k) * L_{n-1}(x_k))

    where :math:`c` is a constant independent of :math:`k` and :math:`x_k`
    is the k'th root of :math:`L_n`, and then scaling the results to get
    the right value when integrating 1.

    
    Evaluate a Legendre series at points x.

    If `c` is of length `n + 1`, this function returns the value:

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 * L_0(x) + c_1 * L_1(x) + ... + c_n * L_n(x)

    The parameter `x` is converted to an array only if it is a tuple or a
    list, otherwise it is treated as a scalar. In either case, either `x`
    or its elements must support multiplication and addition both with
    themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` is a 1-D array, then `p(x)` will have the same shape as `x`.  If
    `c` is multidimensional, then the shape of the result depends on the
    value of `tensor`. If `tensor` is true the shape will be c.shape[1:] +
    x.shape. If `tensor` is false the shape will be c.shape[1:]. Note that
    scalars have shape (,).

    Trailing zeros in the coefficients will be used in the evaluation, so
    they should be avoided if efficiency is a concern.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, compatible object
        If `x` is a list or tuple, it is converted to an ndarray, otherwise
        it is left unchanged and treated as a scalar. In either case, `x`
        or its elements must support addition and multiplication with
        with themselves and with the elements of `c`.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree n are contained in c[n]. If `c` is multidimensional the
        remaining indices enumerate multiple polynomials. In the two
        dimensional case the coefficients may be thought of as stored in
        the columns of `c`.
    tensor : boolean, optional
        If True, the shape of the coefficient array is extended with ones
        on the right, one for each dimension of `x`. Scalars have dimension 0
        for this action. The result is that every column of coefficients in
        `c` is evaluated for every element of `x`. If False, `x` is broadcast
        over the columns of `c` for the evaluation.  This keyword is useful
        when `c` is multidimensional. The default value is True.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, algebra_like
        The shape of the return value is described above.

    --------

    Notes
    -----
    The evaluation uses Clenshaw recursion, aka synthetic division.

    Examples
    --------

    
    Evaluate a 3-D Legendre series at points (x, y, z).

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(x,y,z) = \sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * L_i(x) * L_j(y) * L_k(z)

    The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are converted to arrays only if
    they are tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars and
    they must have the same shape after conversion. In either case, either
    `x`, `y`, and `z` or their elements must support multiplication and
    addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than 3 dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to its
    shape to make it 3-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[3:] +
    x.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible object
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points
        `(x, y, z)`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` must have the same shape.  If
        any of `x`, `y`, or `z` is a list or tuple, it is first converted
        to an ndarray, otherwise it is left unchanged and if it isn't an
        ndarray it is  treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term of
        multi-degree i,j,k is contained in ``c[i,j,k]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than 3 the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the multidimensional polynomial on points formed with
        triples of corresponding values from `x`, `y`, and `z`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    
    Generate a Legendre series with given roots.

    The function returns the coefficients of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = (x - r_0) * (x - r_1) * ... * (x - r_n),

    in Legendre form, where the `r_n` are the roots specified in `roots`.
    If a zero has multiplicity n, then it must appear in `roots` n times.
    For instance, if 2 is a root of multiplicity three and 3 is a root of
    multiplicity 2, then `roots` looks something like [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]. The
    roots can appear in any order.

    If the returned coefficients are `c`, then

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * L_1(x) + ... +  c_n * L_n(x)

    The coefficient of the last term is not generally 1 for monic
    polynomials in Legendre form.

    Parameters
    ----------
    roots : array_like
        Sequence containing the roots.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        1-D array of coefficients.  If all roots are real then `out` is a
        real array, if some of the roots are complex, then `out` is complex
        even if all the coefficients in the result are real (see Examples
        below).

    See Also

    >>> import numpy.polynomial.legendre as L
    >>> L.legfromroots((-1,0,1)) # x^3 - x relative to the standard basis
    array([ 0. , -0.4,  0. ,  0.4])
    >>> j = complex(0,1)
    >>> L.legfromroots((-j,j)) # x^2 + 1 relative to the standard basis
    array([ 1.33333333+0.j,  0.00000000+0.j,  0.66666667+0.j])

    
    Compute the roots of a Legendre series.

    Return the roots (a.k.a. "zeros") of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = \sum_i c[i] * L_i(x).

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : 1-D array_like
        1-D array of coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of the roots of the series. If all the roots are real,
        then `out` is also real, otherwise it is complex.

    See Also
    --------
    polyroots, chebroots, lagroots, hermroots, hermeroots

    Notes
    -----
    The root estimates are obtained as the eigenvalues of the companion
    matrix, Roots far from the origin of the complex plane may have large
    errors due to the numerical instability of the series for such values.
    Roots with multiplicity greater than 1 will also show larger errors as
    the value of the series near such points is relatively insensitive to
    errors in the roots. Isolated roots near the origin can be improved by
    a few iterations of Newton's method.

    The Legendre series basis polynomials aren't powers of ``x`` so the
    results of this function may seem unintuitive.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.polynomial.legendre as leg
    >>> leg.legroots((1, 2, 3, 4)) # 4L_3 + 3L_2 + 2L_1 + 1L_0, all real roots
    array([-0.85099543, -0.11407192,  0.51506735])

    A Legendre series class.

    The Legendre class provides the standard Python numerical methods
    '+', '-', '*', '//', '%', 'divmod', '**', and '()' as well as the
    attributes and methods listed in the `ABCPolyBase` documentation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coef : array_like
        Legendre coefficients in order of increasing degree, i.e.,
        ``(1, 2, 3)`` gives ``1*P_0(x) + 2*P_1(x) + 3*P_2(x)``.
    domain : (2,) array_like, optional
        Domain to use. The interval ``[domain[0], domain[1]]`` is mapped
        to the interval ``[window[0], window[1]]`` by shifting and scaling.
        The default value is [-1, 1].
    window : (2,) array_like, optional
        Window, see `domain` for its use. The default value is [-1, 1].

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degrees.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degrees `deg` and sample
    points `(x, y, z)`. If `l, m, n` are the given degrees in `x, y, z`,
    then The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., (m+1)(n+1)i + (n+1)j + k] = L_i(x)*L_j(y)*L_k(z),

    where `0 <= i <= l`, `0 <= j <= m`, and `0 <= j <= n`.  The leading
    indices of `V` index the points `(x, y, z)` and the last index encodes
    the degrees of the Legendre polynomials.

    If ``V = legvander3d(x, y, z, [xdeg, ydeg, zdeg])``, then the columns
    of `V` correspond to the elements of a 3-D coefficient array `c` of
    shape (xdeg + 1, ydeg + 1, zdeg + 1) in the order

    .. math:: c_{000}, c_{001}, c_{002},... , c_{010}, c_{011}, c_{012},...

    and ``np.dot(V, c.flat)`` and ``legval3d(x, y, z, c)`` will be the
    same up to roundoff. This equivalence is useful both for least squares
    fitting and for the evaluation of a large number of 3-D Legendre
    series of the same degrees and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like
        Arrays of point coordinates, all of the same shape. The dtypes will
        be converted to either float64 or complex128 depending on whether
        any of the elements are complex. Scalars are converted to 1-D
        arrays.
    deg : list of ints
        List of maximum degrees of the form [x_deg, y_deg, z_deg].

    Returns
    -------
    vander3d : ndarray
        The shape of the returned matrix is ``x.shape + (order,)``, where
        :math:`order = (deg[0]+1)*(deg([1]+1)*(deg[2]+1)`.  The dtype will
        be the same as the converted `x`, `y`, and `z`.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(x,y) = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * L_i(x) * L_j(y)

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars and they
    must have the same shape after conversion. In either case, either `x`
    and `y` or their elements must support multiplication and addition both
    with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` is a 1-D array a one is implicitly appended to its shape to make
    it 2-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[2:] + x.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like, compatible objects
        The two dimensional series is evaluated at the points `(x, y)`,
        where `x` and `y` must have the same shape. If `x` or `y` is a list
        or tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is left
        unchanged and if it isn't an ndarray it is treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term
        of multi-degree i,j is contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has

        sets of coefficients.

    Returns
    -------

    Integrate a Legendre series.

    Returns the Legendre series coefficients `c` integrated `m` times from
    `lbnd` along `axis`. At each iteration the resulting series is
    **multiplied** by `scl` and an integration constant, `k`, is added.
    The scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable.  ("Buyer
    beware": note that, depending on what one is doing, one may want `scl`
    to be the reciprocal of what one might expect; for more information,
    see the Notes section below.)  The argument `c` is an array of
    coefficients from low to high degree along each axis, e.g., [1,2,3]
    represents the series ``L_0 + 2*L_1 + 3*L_2`` while [[1,2],[1,2]]
    represents ``1*L_0(x)*L_0(y) + 1*L_1(x)*L_0(y) + 2*L_0(x)*L_1(y) +
    2*L_1(x)*L_1(y)`` if axis=0 is ``x`` and axis=1 is ``y``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        Array of Legendre series coefficients. If c is multidimensional the
        different axis correspond to different variables with the degree in
        each axis given by the corresponding index.
    m : int, optional
        Order of integration, must be positive. (Default: 1)
    k : {[], list, scalar}, optional
        Integration constant(s).  The value of the first integral at
        ``lbnd`` is the first value in the list, the value of the second
        integral at ``lbnd`` is the second value, etc.  If ``k == []`` (the
        default), all constants are set to zero.  If ``m == 1``, a single
        scalar can be given instead of a list.
    lbnd : scalar, optional
        The lower bound of the integral. (Default: 0)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Following each integration the result is *multiplied* by `scl`
        before the integration constant is added. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the integral is taken. (Default: 0).

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    S : ndarray
        Legendre series coefficient array of the integral.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``m < 0``, ``len(k) > m``, ``np.ndim(lbnd) != 0``, or
        ``np.ndim(scl) != 0``.

    See Also
    --------
    legder

    Notes
    -----
    Note that the result of each integration is *multiplied* by `scl`.
    Why is this important to note?  Say one is making a linear change of
    variable :math:`u = ax + b` in an integral relative to `x`.  Then
    :math:`dx = du/a`, so one will need to set `scl` equal to
    :math:`1/a` - perhaps not what one would have first thought.

    Also note that, in general, the result of integrating a C-series needs
    to be "reprojected" onto the C-series basis set.  Thus, typically,
    the result of this function is "unintuitive," albeit correct; see
    Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import legendre as L
    >>> c = (1,2,3)
    >>> L.legint(c)

    Evaluate a 2-D Legendre series on the Cartesian product of x and y.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b) = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * L_i(a) * L_j(b)

    where the points `(a, b)` consist of all pairs formed by taking
    `a` from `x` and `b` from `y`. The resulting points form a grid with
    `x` in the first dimension and `y` in the second.

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In either
    case, either `x` and `y` or their elements must support multiplication
    and addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than two dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 2-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[2:] +
    x.shape + y.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like, compatible objects
        The two dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x` and `y`.  If `x` or `y` is a list or
        tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is left
        unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term of
        multi-degree i,j is contained in `c[i,j]`. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns

    Evaluate a 3-D Legendre series on the Cartesian product of x, y, and z.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b,c) = \sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * L_i(a) * L_j(b) * L_k(c)

    where the points `(a, b, c)` consist of all triples formed by taking
    `a` from `x`, `b` from `y`, and `c` from `z`. The resulting points form
    a grid with `x` in the first dimension, `y` in the second, and `z` in

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible objects
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x`, `y`, and `z`.  If `x`,`y`, or `z` is a
        list or tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is
        left unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a

    where the `r_n` are the roots specified in `roots`.  If a zero has
    multiplicity n, then it must appear in `roots` n times. For instance,
    if 2 is a root of multiplicity three and 3 is a root of multiplicity 2,
    then `roots` looks something like [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]. The roots can appear
    in any order.

    If the returned coefficients are `c`, then

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * x + ... +  x^n

    The coefficient of the last term is 1 for monic polynomials in this
    form.

    Parameters
    ----------
    roots : array_like
        Sequence containing the roots.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        1-D array of the polynomial's coefficients If all the roots are
        real, then `out` is also real, otherwise it is complex.  (see
        Examples below).

    hermefromroots

    Notes
    -----
    The coefficients are determined by multiplying together linear factors
    of the form `(x - r_i)`, i.e.

    .. math:: p(x) = (x - r_0) (x - r_1) ... (x - r_n)

    where ``n == len(roots) - 1``; note that this implies that `1` is always
    returned for :math:`a_n`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> P.polyfromroots((-1,0,1)) # x(x - 1)(x + 1) = x^3 - x
    array([ 0., -1.,  0.,  1.])
    >>> j = complex(0,1)
    >>> P.polyfromroots((-j,j)) # complex returned, though values are real
    array([ 1.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  1.+0.j])

    
    Evaluate a 2-D polynomial on the Cartesian product of x and y.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b) = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * a^i * b^j

    where the points `(a, b)` consist of all pairs formed by taking
    `a` from `x` and `b` from `y`. The resulting points form a grid with
    `x` in the first dimension and `y` in the second.

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In either
    case, either `x` and `y` or their elements must support multiplication
    and addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than two dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 2-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[2:] +
    x.shape + y.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like, compatible objects
        The two dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x` and `y`.  If `x` or `y` is a list or
        tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is left
        unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree i,j are contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional polynomial at points in the Cartesian
        product of `x` and `y`.

    x.ndim must be < r.ndim when tensor == FalsePseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degrees.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degrees `deg` and sample
    points `(x, y)`. The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., (deg[1] + 1)*i + j] = x^i * y^j,

    where `0 <= i <= deg[0]` and `0 <= j <= deg[1]`. The leading indices of
    `V` index the points `(x, y)` and the last index encodes the powers of
    `x` and `y`.

    If ``V = polyvander2d(x, y, [xdeg, ydeg])``, then the columns of `V`
    correspond to the elements of a 2-D coefficient array `c` of shape
    (xdeg + 1, ydeg + 1) in the order

    .. math:: c_{00}, c_{01}, c_{02} ... , c_{10}, c_{11}, c_{12} ...

    and ``np.dot(V, c.flat)`` and ``polyval2d(x, y, c)`` will be the same
    up to roundoff. This equivalence is useful both for least squares
    fitting and for the evaluation of a large number of 2-D polynomials
    of the same degrees and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        Arrays of point coordinates, all of the same shape. The dtypes
        will be converted to either float64 or complex128 depending on
        whether any of the elements are complex. Scalars are converted to
        1-D arrays.
    deg : list of ints
        List of maximum degrees of the form [x_deg, y_deg].

    Returns
    -------
    vander2d : ndarray
        The shape of the returned matrix is ``x.shape + (order,)``, where
        :math:`order = (deg[0]+1)*(deg([1]+1)`.  The dtype will be the same
        as the converted `x` and `y`.

    polydomain<module numpy.polynomial.polynomial>Polynomial._repr_latex_term{}^{{{}}}
    Compute the roots of a polynomial.

    Return the roots (a.k.a. "zeros") of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = \sum_i c[i] * x^i.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : 1-D array_like
        1-D array of polynomial coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of the roots of the polynomial. If all the roots are real,
        then `out` is also real, otherwise it is complex.

    Notes
    -----
    The root estimates are obtained as the eigenvalues of the companion
    matrix, Roots far from the origin of the complex plane may have large
    errors due to the numerical instability of the power series for such
    values. Roots with multiplicity greater than 1 will also show larger
    errors as the value of the series near such points is relatively
    insensitive to errors in the roots. Isolated roots near the origin can
    be improved by a few iterations of Newton's method.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.polynomial.polynomial as poly
    >>> poly.polyroots(poly.polyfromroots((-1,0,1)))
    array([-1.,  0.,  1.])
    >>> poly.polyroots(poly.polyfromroots((-1,0,1))).dtype

    Evaluate a polynomial specified by its roots at points x.

    If `r` is of length `N`, this function returns the value

    .. math:: p(x) = \prod_{n=1}^{N} (x - r_n)

    The parameter `x` is converted to an array only if it is a tuple or a
    list, otherwise it is treated as a scalar. In either case, either `x`
    or its elements must support multiplication and addition both with
    themselves and with the elements of `r`.

    If `r` is a 1-D array, then `p(x)` will have the same shape as `x`.  If `r`
    is multidimensional, then the shape of the result depends on the value of
    `tensor`. If `tensor is ``True`` the shape will be r.shape[1:] + x.shape;
    that is, each polynomial is evaluated at every value of `x`. If `tensor` is
    ``False``, the shape will be r.shape[1:]; that is, each polynomial is
    evaluated only for the corresponding broadcast value of `x`. Note that
    scalars have shape (,).

    .. versionadded:: 1.12

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, compatible object
        If `x` is a list or tuple, it is converted to an ndarray, otherwise
        it is left unchanged and treated as a scalar. In either case, `x`
        or its elements must support addition and multiplication with
        with themselves and with the elements of `r`.
    r : array_like
        Array of roots. If `r` is multidimensional the first index is the
        root index, while the remaining indices enumerate multiple
        polynomials. For instance, in the two dimensional case the roots
        of each polynomial may be thought of as stored in the columns of `r`.
    tensor : boolean, optional
        If True, the shape of the roots array is extended with ones on the
        right, one for each dimension of `x`. Scalars have dimension 0 for this
        action. The result is that every column of coefficients in `r` is
        evaluated for every element of `x`. If False, `x` is broadcast over the
        columns of `r` for the evaluation.  This keyword is useful when `r` is
        multidimensional. The default value is True.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The shape of the returned array is described above.

    Add one polynomial to another.

    Returns the sum of two polynomials `c1` + `c2`.  The arguments are
    sequences of coefficients from lowest order term to highest, i.e.,
    [1,2,3] represents the polynomial ``1 + 2*x + 3*x**2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of polynomial coefficients ordered from low to high.

    Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degrees.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degrees `deg` and sample
    points `(x, y, z)`. If `l, m, n` are the given degrees in `x, y, z`,
    then The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., (m+1)(n+1)i + (n+1)j + k] = x^i * y^j * z^k,

    where `0 <= i <= l`, `0 <= j <= m`, and `0 <= j <= n`.  The leading
    indices of `V` index the points `(x, y, z)` and the last index encodes
    the powers of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

    If ``V = polyvander3d(x, y, z, [xdeg, ydeg, zdeg])``, then the columns
    of `V` correspond to the elements of a 3-D coefficient array `c` of
    shape (xdeg + 1, ydeg + 1, zdeg + 1) in the order

    .. math:: c_{000}, c_{001}, c_{002},... , c_{010}, c_{011}, c_{012},...

    and  ``np.dot(V, c.flat)`` and ``polyval3d(x, y, z, c)`` will be the
    same up to roundoff. This equivalence is useful both for least squares
    fitting and for the evaluation of a large number of 3-D polynomials
    of the same degrees and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like
        Arrays of point coordinates, all of the same shape. The dtypes will
        be converted to either float64 or complex128 depending on whether
        any of the elements are complex. Scalars are converted to 1-D
        arrays.

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars and they
    must have the same shape after conversion. In either case, either `x`
    and `y` or their elements must support multiplication and addition both

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b,c) = \sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * a^i * b^j * c^k

    where the points `(a, b, c)` consist of all triples formed by taking

    a grid with `x` in the first dimension, `y` in the second, and `z` in
    the third.

    The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are converted to arrays only if they
    are tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In
    either case, either `x`, `y`, and `z` or their elements must support
    multiplication and addition both with themselves and with the elements
    of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than three dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to

    x.shape + y.shape + z.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible objects
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x`, `y`, and `z`.  If `x`,`y`, or `z` is a

        scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree i,j are contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has dimension

    Vandermonde matrix of given degree.

    Returns the Vandermonde matrix of degree `deg` and sample points
    `x`. The Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., i] = x^i,

    where `0 <= i <= deg`. The leading indices of `V` index the elements of
    `x` and the last index is the power of `x`.

    If `c` is a 1-D array of coefficients of length `n + 1` and `V` is the
    matrix ``V = polyvander(x, n)``, then ``np.dot(V, c)`` and
    ``polyval(x, c)`` are the same up to roundoff. This equivalence is
    useful both for least squares fitting and for the evaluation of a large
    number of polynomials of the same degree and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Array of points. The dtype is converted to float64 or complex128
        depending on whether any of the elements are complex. If `x` is
        scalar it is converted to a 1-D array.
    deg : int
        Degree of the resulting matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    vander : ndarray.
        The Vandermonde matrix. The shape of the returned matrix is
        ``x.shape + (deg + 1,)``, where the last index is the power of `x`.
        The dtype will be the same as the converted `x`.

    Least-squares fit of a polynomial to data.

    Return the coefficients of a polynomial of degree `deg` that is the
    least squares fit to the data values `y` given at points `x`. If `y` is
    1-D the returned coefficients will also be 1-D. If `y` is 2-D multiple
    fits are done, one for each column of `y`, and the resulting
    coefficients are stored in the corresponding columns of a 2-D return.
    The fitted polynomial(s) are in the form

    .. math::  p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * x + ... + c_n * x^n,

    where `n` is `deg`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (`M`,)
        x-coordinates of the `M` sample (data) points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
    y : array_like, shape (`M`,) or (`M`, `K`)
        y-coordinates of the sample points.  Several sets of sample points
        sharing the same x-coordinates can be (independently) fit with one
        call to `polyfit` by passing in for `y` a 2-D array that contains
        one data set per column.
    deg : int or 1-D array_like
        Degree(s) of the fitting polynomials. If `deg` is a single integer
        all terms up to and including the `deg`'th term are included in the
        fit. For NumPy versions >= 1.11.0 a list of integers specifying the
        degrees of the terms to include may be used instead.
    rcond : float, optional
        Relative condition number of the fit.  Singular values smaller
        than `rcond`, relative to the largest singular value, will be
        ignored.  The default value is ``len(x)*eps``, where `eps` is the
        relative precision of the platform's float type, about 2e-16 in
        most cases.
    full : bool, optional
        Switch determining the nature of the return value.  When ``False``
        (the default) just the coefficients are returned; when ``True``,
        diagnostic information from the singular value decomposition (used
        to solve the fit's matrix equation) is also returned.
    w : array_like, shape (`M`,), optional
        Weights. If not None, the contribution of each point
        ``(x[i],y[i])`` to the fit is weighted by `w[i]`. Ideally the
        weights are chosen so that the errors of the products ``w[i]*y[i]``
        all have the same variance.  The default value is None.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray, shape (`deg` + 1,) or (`deg` + 1, `K`)
        Polynomial coefficients ordered from low to high.  If `y` was 2-D,
        the coefficients in column `k` of `coef` represent the polynomial
        fit to the data in `y`'s `k`-th column.

    [residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond] : list
        These values are only returned if `full` = True

        resid -- sum of squared residuals of the least squares fit
        rank -- the numerical rank of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        sv -- singular values of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        rcond -- value of `rcond`.

        For more details, see `linalg.lstsq`.

    Raises
    ------
    RankWarning
        Raised if the matrix in the least-squares fit is rank deficient.
        The warning is only raised if `full` == False.  The warnings can
        be turned off by:

        >>> import warnings
        >>> warnings.simplefilter('ignore', RankWarning)

    Notes
    -----
    The solution is the coefficients of the polynomial `p` that minimizes
    the sum of the weighted squared errors

    .. math :: E = \sum_j w_j^2 * |y_j - p(x_j)|^2,

    where the :math:`w_j` are the weights. This problem is solved by
    setting up the (typically) over-determined matrix equation:

    .. math :: V(x) * c = w * y,

    where `V` is the weighted pseudo Vandermonde matrix of `x`, `c` are the
    coefficients to be solved for, `w` are the weights, and `y` are the
    observed values.  This equation is then solved using the singular value
    decomposition of `V`.

    If some of the singular values of `V` are so small that they are
    neglected (and `full` == ``False``), a `RankWarning` will be raised.
    This means that the coefficient values may be poorly determined.
    Fitting to a lower order polynomial will usually get rid of the warning
    (but may not be what you want, of course; if you have independent
    reason(s) for choosing the degree which isn't working, you may have to:
    a) reconsider those reasons, and/or b) reconsider the quality of your
    data).  The `rcond` parameter can also be set to a value smaller than
    its default, but the resulting fit may be spurious and have large
    contributions from roundoff error.

    Polynomial fits using double precision tend to "fail" at about
    (polynomial) degree 20. Fits using Chebyshev or Legendre series are
    generally better conditioned, but much can still depend on the
    distribution of the sample points and the smoothness of the data.  If
    the quality of the fit is inadequate, splines may be a good
    alternative.

    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> x = np.linspace(-1,1,51) # x "data": [-1, -0.96, ..., 0.96, 1]

    .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

    A power series class.

    The Polynomial class provides the standard Python numerical methods
    '+', '-', '*', '//', '%', 'divmod', '**', and '()' as well as the
    attributes and methods listed in the `ABCPolyBase` documentation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coef : array_like
        Polynomial coefficients in order of increasing degree, i.e.,
        ``(1, 2, 3)`` give ``1 + 2*x + 3*x**2``.
    domain : (2,) array_like, optional
        Domain to use. The interval ``[domain[0], domain[1]]`` is mapped

        The default value is [-1, 1].
    window : (2,) array_like, optional
        Window, see `domain` for its use. The default value is [-1, 1].

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    
    Multiply one polynomial by another.

    Returns the product of two polynomials `c1` * `c2`.  The arguments are

    out : ndarray
        Of the coefficients of their product.

    See Also
    --------
    polyadd, polysub, polymulx, polydiv, polypow

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> P.polymul(c1,c2)
    array([  3.,   8.,  14.,   8.,   3.])

    
    Subtract one polynomial from another.

    Returns the difference of two polynomials `c1` - `c2`.  The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients from lowest order term to highest, i.e.,
    [1,2,3] represents the polynomial ``1 + 2*x + 3*x**2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of polynomial coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Of coefficients representing their difference.

    See Also
    --------
    polyadd, polymulx, polymul, polydiv, polypow

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> P.polysub(c1,c2)
    array([-2.,  0.,  2.])
    >>> P.polysub(c2,c1) # -P.polysub(c1,c2)
    array([ 2.,  0., -2.])

    
    Integrate a polynomial.

    Returns the polynomial coefficients `c` integrated `m` times from
    `lbnd` along `axis`.  At each iteration the resulting series is
    **multiplied** by `scl` and an integration constant, `k`, is added.
    The scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable.  ("Buyer
    beware": note that, depending on what one is doing, one may want `scl`
    to be the reciprocal of what one might expect; for more information,
    see the Notes section below.) The argument `c` is an array of
    coefficients, from low to high degree along each axis, e.g., [1,2,3]
    represents the polynomial ``1 + 2*x + 3*x**2`` while [[1,2],[1,2]]
    represents ``1 + 1*x + 2*y + 2*x*y`` if axis=0 is ``x`` and axis=1 is
    ``y``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of polynomial coefficients, ordered from low to high.
    m : int, optional
        Order of integration, must be positive. (Default: 1)
    k : {[], list, scalar}, optional
        Integration constant(s).  The value of the first integral at zero
        is the first value in the list, the value of the second integral
        at zero is the second value, etc.  If ``k == []`` (the default),
        all constants are set to zero.  If ``m == 1``, a single scalar can
        be given instead of a list.
    lbnd : scalar, optional
        The lower bound of the integral. (Default: 0)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Following each integration the result is *multiplied* by `scl`
        before the integration constant is added. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the integral is taken. (Default: 0).

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    S : ndarray
        Coefficient array of the integral.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``m < 1``, ``len(k) > m``, ``np.ndim(lbnd) != 0``, or
        ``np.ndim(scl) != 0``.

    See Also
    --------
    polyder

    Notes
    -----
    Note that the result of each integration is *multiplied* by `scl`.  Why
    is this important to note?  Say one is making a linear change of
    variable :math:`u = ax + b` in an integral relative to `x`. Then
    :math:`dx = du/a`, so one will need to set `scl` equal to
    :math:`1/a` - perhaps not what one would have first thought.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> c = (1,2,3)
    >>> P.polyint(c) # should return array([0, 1, 1, 1])
    array([ 0.,  1.,  1.,  1.])
    >>> P.polyint(c,3) # should return array([0, 0, 0, 1/6, 1/12, 1/20])
    array([ 0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ,  0.16666667,  0.08333333,
            0.05      ])
    >>> P.polyint(c,k=3) # should return array([3, 1, 1, 1])
    array([ 3.,  1.,  1.,  1.])
    >>> P.polyint(c,lbnd=-2) # should return array([6, 1, 1, 1])
    array([ 6.,  1.,  1.,  1.])
    >>> P.polyint(c,scl=-2) # should return array([0, -2, -2, -2])
    array([ 0., -2., -2., -2.])

    
    Evaluate a 3-D polynomial at points (x, y, z).

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(x,y,z) = \sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * x^i * y^j * z^k

    The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are converted to arrays only if
    they are tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars and
    they must have the same shape after conversion. In either case, either
    `x`, `y`, and `z` or their elements must support multiplication and
    addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than 3 dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to its
    shape to make it 3-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[3:] +
    x.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible object
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points
        `(x, y, z)`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` must have the same shape.  If
        any of `x`, `y`, or `z` is a list or tuple, it is first converted
        to an ndarray, otherwise it is left unchanged and if it isn't an
        ndarray it is  treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term of
        multi-degree i,j,k is contained in ``c[i,j,k]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than 3 the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the multidimensional polynomial on points formed with
        triples of corresponding values from `x`, `y`, and `z`.

    Raise a polynomial to a power.

    Returns the polynomial `c` raised to the power `pow`. The argument
    `c` is a sequence of coefficients ordered from low to high. i.e.,
    [1,2,3] is the series  ``1 + 2*x + 3*x**2.``

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of array of series coefficients ordered from low to
        high degree.
    pow : integer
        Power to which the series will be raised
    maxpower : integer, optional
        Maximum power allowed. This is mainly to limit growth of the series
        to unmanageable size. Default is 16

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray
        Power series of power.

\left({}\right)
    Differentiate a polynomial.

    Returns the polynomial coefficients `c` differentiated `m` times along
    `axis`.  At each iteration the result is multiplied by `scl` (the
    scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable).  The
    argument `c` is an array of coefficients from low to high degree along
    each axis, e.g., [1,2,3] represents the polynomial ``1 + 2*x + 3*x**2``
    while [[1,2],[1,2]] represents ``1 + 1*x + 2*y + 2*x*y`` if axis=0 is
    ``x`` and axis=1 is ``y``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        Array of polynomial coefficients. If c is multidimensional the
        different axis correspond to different variables with the degree
        in each axis given by the corresponding index.
    m : int, optional
        Number of derivatives taken, must be non-negative. (Default: 1)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Each differentiation is multiplied by `scl`.  The end result is
        multiplication by ``scl**m``.  This is for use in a linear change
        of variable. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the derivative is taken. (Default: 0).

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    der : ndarray
        Polynomial coefficients of the derivative.

    See Also
    --------
    polyint

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> c = (1,2,3,4) # 1 + 2x + 3x**2 + 4x**3
    >>> P.polyder(c) # (d/dx)(c) = 2 + 6x + 12x**2
    array([  2.,   6.,  12.])
    >>> P.polyder(c,3) # (d**3/dx**3)(c) = 24
    array([ 24.])
    >>> P.polyder(c,scl=-1) # (d/d(-x))(c) = -2 - 6x - 12x**2
    array([ -2.,  -6., -12.])
    >>> P.polyder(c,2,-1) # (d**2/d(-x)**2)(c) = 6 + 24x
    array([  6.,  24.])

    
    Evaluate a polynomial at points x.

    If `c` is of length `n + 1`, this function returns the value

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * x + ... + c_n * x^n

    The parameter `x` is converted to an array only if it is a tuple or a
    list, otherwise it is treated as a scalar. In either case, either `x`
    or its elements must support multiplication and addition both with
    themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` is a 1-D array, then `p(x)` will have the same shape as `x`.  If
    `c` is multidimensional, then the shape of the result depends on the
    value of `tensor`. If `tensor` is true the shape will be c.shape[1:] +
    x.shape. If `tensor` is false the shape will be c.shape[1:]. Note that
    scalars have shape (,).

    Trailing zeros in the coefficients will be used in the evaluation, so
    they should be avoided if efficiency is a concern.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, compatible object
        If `x` is a list or tuple, it is converted to an ndarray, otherwise
        it is left unchanged and treated as a scalar. In either case, `x`
        or its elements must support addition and multiplication with
        with themselves and with the elements of `c`.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree n are contained in c[n]. If `c` is multidimensional the
        remaining indices enumerate multiple polynomials. In the two
        dimensional case the coefficients may be thought of as stored in
        the columns of `c`.
    tensor : boolean, optional
        If True, the shape of the coefficient array is extended with ones
        on the right, one for each dimension of `x`. Scalars have dimension 0
        for this action. The result is that every column of coefficients in
        `c` is evaluated for every element of `x`. If False, `x` is broadcast
        over the columns of `c` for the evaluation.  This keyword is useful
        when `c` is multidimensional. The default value is True.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The shape of the returned array is described above.

    Notes
    -----
    The evaluation uses Horner's method.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.polynomial import polyval
    >>> polyval(1, [1,2,3])

    PolyDomainError/home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/polynomial/polyutils.py
    Base class for all polynomial types.

    Deprecated in numpy 1.9.0, use the abstract
    ABCPolyBase class instead. Note that the latter
    requires a number of virtual functions to be
    implemented.

    oldlennewlenRemove small Poly series coefficients.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seq : sequence
        Sequence of Poly series coefficients. This routine fails for
        empty sequences.

    Returns
    -------
    series : sequence
        Subsequence with trailing zeros removed. If the resulting sequence
        would be empty, return the first element. The returned sequence may
        or may not be a view.

    Notes
    -----
    Do not lose the type info if the sequence contains unknown objects.

    PolyErrortol must be non-negativeIssued by chebfit when the design matrix is rank deficient.Issued by the generic Poly class when two domains don't match.

    This is raised when an binary operation is passed Poly objects with

    Linear map parameters between domains.

    Return the parameters of the linear map ``offset + scale*x`` that maps
    `old` to `new` such that ``old[i] -> new[i]``, ``i = 0, 1``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    old, new : array_like
        Domains. Each domain must (successfully) convert to a 1-d array
        containing precisely two values.

    Returns
    -------
    offset, scale : scalars
        The map ``L(x) = offset + scale*x`` maps the first domain to the
        second.

    parameters required to map any line in the complex plane to any other
    line therein.

    Base class for errors in this module.
    Return a domain suitable for given abscissae.

    Find a domain suitable for a polynomial or Chebyshev series
    defined at the values supplied.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        1-d array of abscissae whose domain will be determined.

    Returns
    -------
    domain : ndarray
        1-d array containing two values.  If the inputs are complex, then
        the two returned points are the lower left and upper right corners
        of the smallest rectangle (aligned with the axes) in the complex
        plane containing the points `x`. If the inputs are real, then the
        two points are the ends of the smallest interval containing the
        points `x`.

    --------
    mapparms, mapdomain

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polyutils as pu
    >>> points = np.arange(4)**2 - 5; points
    array([-5, -4, -1,  4])
    >>> pu.getdomain(points)
    array([-5.,  4.])
    >>> c = np.exp(complex(0,1)*np.pi*np.arange(12)/6) # unit circle
    >>> pu.getdomain(c)
    array([-1.-1.j,  1.+1.j])

    Coefficient array is emptyimax
    Remove "small" "trailing" coefficients from a polynomial.

    "Small" means "small in absolute value" and is controlled by the
    parameter `tol`; "trailing" means highest order coefficient(s), e.g., in
    ``[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]`` (which represents ``0 + x + x**2 + 0*x**3 + 0*x**4``)
    both the 3-rd and 4-th order coefficients would be "trimmed."

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-d array of coefficients, ordered from lowest order to highest.
    tol : number, optional
        Trailing (i.e., highest order) elements with absolute value less
        than or equal to `tol` (default value is zero) are removed.

    Returns
    -------
    trimmed : ndarray
        1-d array with trailing zeros removed.  If the resulting series
        would be empty, a series containing a single zero is returned.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `tol` < 0

    See Also
    --------
    trimseq

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polyutils as pu
    >>> pu.trimcoef((0,0,3,0,5,0,0))
    array([ 0.,  0.,  3.,  0.,  5.])
    >>> pu.trimcoef((0,0,1e-3,0,1e-5,0,0),1e-3) # item == tol is trimmed
    array([ 0.])
    >>> i = complex(0,1) # works for complex
    >>> pu.trimcoef((3e-4,1e-3*(1-i),5e-4,2e-5*(1+i)), 1e-3)
    array([ 0.0003+0.j   ,  0.0010-0.001j])

    
    Apply linear map to input points.

    The linear map ``offset + scale*x`` that maps the domain `old` to
    the domain `new` is applied to the points `x`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Points to be mapped. If `x` is a subtype of ndarray the subtype
        will be preserved.
    old, new : array_like
        The two domains that determine the map.  Each must (successfully)
        convert to 1-d arrays containing precisely two values.

    Returns
    -------
    x_out : ndarray
        Array of points of the same shape as `x`, after application of the
        linear map between the two domains.

    See Also
    --------
    getdomain, mapparms

    Notes
    -----
    Effectively, this implements:

    .. math ::
        x\_out = new[0] + m(x - old[0])

    where

    .. math ::
        m = \frac{new[1]-new[0]}{old[1]-old[0]}

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polyutils as pu
    >>> old_domain = (-1,1)
    >>> new_domain = (0,2*np.pi)
    >>> x = np.linspace(-1,1,6); x
    array([-1. , -0.6, -0.2,  0.2,  0.6,  1. ])
    >>> x_out = pu.mapdomain(x, old_domain, new_domain); x_out
    array([ 0.        ,  1.25663706,  2.51327412,  3.76991118,  5.02654825,
            6.28318531])
    >>> x - pu.mapdomain(x_out, new_domain, old_domain)
    array([ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.])

    Also works for complex numbers (and thus can be used to map any line in
    the complex plane to any other line therein).

    >>> i = complex(0,1)
    >>> old = (-1 - i, 1 + i)
    >>> new = (-1 + i, 1 - i)
    >>> z = np.linspace(old[0], old[1], 6); z
    array([-1.0-1.j , -0.6-0.6j, -0.2-0.2j,  0.2+0.2j,  0.6+0.6j,  1.0+1.j ])
    >>> new_z = P.mapdomain(z, old, new); new_z
    array([-1.0+1.j , -0.6+0.6j, -0.2+0.2j,  0.2-0.2j,  0.6-0.6j,  1.0-1.j ])

    
    Return argument as a list of 1-d arrays.

    The returned list contains array(s) of dtype double, complex double, or
    object.  A 1-d argument of shape ``(N,)`` is parsed into ``N`` arrays of
    size one; a 2-d argument of shape ``(M,N)`` is parsed into ``M`` arrays
    of size ``N`` (i.e., is "parsed by row"); and a higher dimensional array
    raises a Value Error if it is not first reshaped into either a 1-d or 2-d
    array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alist : array_like
        A 1- or 2-d array_like
    trim : boolean, optional
        When True, trailing zeros are removed from the inputs.
        When False, the inputs are passed through intact.

    Returns
    -------
    [a1, a2,...] : list of 1-D arrays
        A copy of the input data as a list of 1-d arrays.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raised when `as_series` cannot convert its input to 1-d arrays, or at
        least one of the resulting arrays is empty.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polyutils as pu
    >>> a = np.arange(4)
    >>> pu.as_series(a)
    [array([ 0.]), array([ 1.]), array([ 2.]), array([ 3.])]
    >>> b = np.arange(6).reshape((2,3))
    >>> pu.as_series(b)
    [array([ 0.,  1.,  2.]), array([ 3.,  4.,  5.])]

    >>> pu.as_series((1, np.arange(3), np.arange(2, dtype=np.float16)))
    [array([ 1.]), array([ 0.,  1.,  2.]), array([ 0.,  1.])]

    >>> pu.as_series([2, [1.1, 0.]])
    [array([ 2.]), array([ 1.1])]

    >>> pu.as_series([2, [1.1, 0.]], trim=False)
    [array([ 2.]), array([ 1.1,  0. ])]

Utility classes and functions for the polynomial modules.

This module provides: error and warning objects; a polynomial base class;
and some routines used in both the `polynomial` and `chebyshev` modules.

Base class
----------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   PolyBase Obsolete base class for the polynomial classes. Do not use.

Functions
---------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   as_series    convert list of array_likes into 1-D arrays of common type.
   trimseq      remove trailing zeros.
   trimcoef     remove small trailing coefficients.
   getdomain    return the domain appropriate for a given set of abscissae.
   mapdomain    maps points between domains.
   mapparms     parameters of the linear map between domains.

numpy.polynomial.polyutils<module numpy.polynomial.polyutils>Return a RandomState instance.

    This function exists solely to assist (un)pickling.

    Note that the state of the RandomState returned here is irrelevant, as this function's
    entire purpose is to return a newly allocated RandomState whose state pickle can set.
    Consequently the RandomState returned by this function is a freshly allocated copy
    with a seed=0.

    Reference Sound samples into an array.

    Creates a new array that directly references the samples in a Sound
    object. Modifying the array will change the Sound. The array will
    always be in the format returned from pygame.mixer.get_init().
    pygame._numpysndarray.make_sound(array): return Sound

    Convert an array into a Sound object.
    
    Create a new playable Sound object from an array. The mixer module
    must be initialized and the array format must be similar to the mixer
    audio format.
    /home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pygame/_numpysndarray.pypygame module for accessing sound sample data using numpy

Functions to convert between numpy arrays and Sound objects. This module
will only be available when pygame can use the external numpy package.

Sound data is made of thousands of samples per second, and each sample
is the amplitude of the wave at a particular moment in time. For
example, in 22-kHz format, element number 5 of the array is the
amplitude of the wave after 5/22000 seconds.

Each sample is an 8-bit or 16-bit integer, depending on the data format.
A stereo sound file has two values per sample, while a mono sound file
only has one.
<module pygame._numpysndarray>pygame._numpysndarray.array(Sound): return array

    Copy Sound samples into an array.

    Creates a new array for the sound data and copies the samples. The
    array will always be in the format returned from
    pygame.mixer.get_init().
    surface_to_arrayget_bitsizepix_make_surfacepygame.numpyarray.pixels_alpha(Surface): return array

    reference pixel alphas into a 2d array

    Create a new 2D array that directly references the alpha values
    (degree of transparency) in a Surface. Any changes to the array will
    affect the pixels in the Surface. This is a fast operation since no
    data is copied.

    This can only work on 32-bit Surfaces with a per-pixel alpha value.

    The Surface this array references will remain locked for the
    lifetime of the array.
    pygame.numpyarray.array_green(Surface): return array

    copy pixel green into a 2d array

    Copy the pixel green values from a Surface into a 2D array. This will work
    for any type of Surface format.

    This function will temporarily lock the Surface as pixels are copied
    (see the Surface.lock - lock the Surface memory for pixel access
    method).
    pygame.surfarray.pixels_blue(Surface): return array

    Reference pixel blue into a 2d array.

    Create a new 2D array that directly references the blue values
    in a Surface. Any changes to the array will affect the pixels
    in the Surface. This is a fast operation since no data is copied.

    This can only work on 24-bit or 32-bit Surfaces.

    The Surface this array references will remain locked for the
    lifetime of the array.
    float float32 float64 float96array_bluepygame.numpyarray.array_red(Surface): return array

    copy pixel red into a 2d array

    Copy the pixel red values from a Surface into a 2D array. This will work
    for any type of Surface format.

    This function will temporarily lock the Surface as pixels are copied
    (see the Surface.lock - lock the Surface memory for pixel access
    method).

    Reference pixel red into a 2d array.

    Create a new 2D array that directly references the red values
    in a Surface. Any changes to the array will affect the pixels
    in the Surface. This is a fast operation since no data is copied.

    This can only work on 24-bit or 32-bit Surfaces.

    The Surface this array references will remain locked for the
    lifetime of the array.
    pygame.numpyarray.array_alpha(Surface): return array

    copy pixel alphas into a 2d array

    Copy the pixel alpha values (degree of transparency) from a Surface
    into a 2D array. This will work for any type of Surface
    format. Surfaces without a pixel alpha will return an array with all
    opaque values.

    This function will temporarily lock the Surface as pixels are copied
    (see the Surface.lock - lock the Surface memory for pixel access
    method).
    pix_map_arrayunsupport bit depth for 2D reference arraypygame.numpyarray.pixels2d(Surface): return array

    reference pixels into a 2d array
    
    Create a new 2D array that directly references the pixel values in a
    Surface. Any changes to the array will affect the pixels in the
    Surface. This is a fast operation since no data is copied.

    Pixels from a 24-bit Surface cannot be referenced, but all other
    Surface bit depths can.

    The Surface this references will remain locked for the lifetime of
    the array (see the Surface.lock - lock the Surface memory for pixel
    access method).
    numpy_arraypygame.numpyarray.array_colorkey(Surface): return array

    copy the colorkey values into a 2d array

    Create a new array with the colorkey transparency value from each
    pixel. If the pixel matches the colorkey it will be fully
    tranparent; otherwise it will be fully opaque.

    This will work on any type of Surface format. If the image has no
    colorkey a solid opaque array will be returned.

    This function will temporarily lock the Surface as pixels are
    copied.
    <module pygame._numpysurfarray>numpy_floatspygame module for accessing surface pixel data using numpy

Functions to convert pixel data between pygame Surfaces and Numpy
arrays. This module will only be available when pygame can use the
external Numpy package.

Note, that numpyarray is an optional module. It requires that Numpy is
installed to be used. If not installed, an exception will be raised when
it is used. eg. ImportError: no module named numpy

Every pixel is stored as a single integer value to represent the red,
green, and blue colors. The 8bit images use a value that looks into a
colormap. Pixels with higher depth use a bit packing process to place
three or four values into a single number.

The Numpy arrays are indexed by the X axis first, followed by the Y
axis. Arrays that treat the pixels as a single integer are referred to
as 2D arrays. This module can also separate the red, green, and blue
color values into separate indices. These types of arrays are referred
to as 3D arrays, and the last index is 0 for red, 1 for green, and 2 for
blue.

In contrast to Numeric Numpy does use unsigned 16bit integers, images
with 16bit data will be treated as unsigned integers.
bpppygame.numpyarray.map_array(Surface, array3d): return array2d

    map a 3d array into a 2d array

    Convert a 3D array into a 2D array. This will use the given Surface
    format to control the conversion.

    Note: arrays do not need to be 3D, as long as the minor axis has
    three elements giving the component colours, any array shape can be
    used (for example, a single colour can be mapped, or an array of
    colours). The array shape is limited to eleven dimensions maximum,
    including the three element minor axis.
    bit depth %i unsupported for 2D reference arraypygame.numpyarray.array3d(Surface): return array

    copy pixels into a 3d array

    Copy the pixels from a Surface into a 3D array. The bit depth of the
    surface will control the size of the integer values, and will work
    for any type of pixel format.

    This function will temporarily lock the Surface as pixels are copied
    (see the Surface.lock - lock the Surface memory for pixel access
    method).
    _pixel2d_bitdepths/home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pygame/_numpysurfarray.pypygame.numpyarray.array2d(Surface): return array

    copy pixels into a 2d array

    Copy the pixels from a Surface into a 2D array. The bit depth of the
    surface will control the size of the integer values, and will work
    for any type of pixel format.

    This function will temporarily lock the Surface as pixels are copied
    (see the Surface.lock - lock the Surface memory for pixel access
    method).
    get_sizenumpy_uint32pygame.surfarray.pixels_green(Surface): return array

    Reference pixel green into a 2d array.

    Create a new 2D array that directly references the green values
    in a Surface. Any changes to the array will affect the pixels
    in the Surface. This is a fast operation since no data is copied.

    This can only work on 24-bit or 32-bit Surfaces.

    The Surface this array references will remain locked for the
    lifetime of the array.
    unsupported bit depth %i for 2D arraypygame.numpyarray.pixels3d(Surface): return array

    reference pixels into a 3d array

    Create a new 3D array that directly references the pixel values in a
    Surface. Any changes to the array will affect the pixels in the
    Surface. This is a fast operation since no data is copied.

    This will only work on Surfaces that have 24-bit or 32-bit
    formats. Lower pixel formats cannot be referenced.

    The Surface this references will remain locked for the lifetime of
    the array (see the Surface.lock - lock the Surface memory for pixel
    access method).
    pygame.numpyarray.array_blue(Surface): return array

    copy pixel blue into a 2d array

    Copy the pixel blue values from a Surface into a 2D array. This will work
    for any type of Surface format.

compile cursor strings into cursor data

This takes a set of strings with equal length and computes
the binary data for that cursor. The string widths must be
divisible by 8.

The black and white arguments are single letter strings that
tells which characters will represent black pixels, and which
characters represent white pixels. All other characters are
considered clear.

This returns a tuple containing the cursor data and cursor mask
data. Both these arguments are used when setting a cursor with
pygame.mouse.set_cursor().
pygame.cursors.load_xbm(cursorfile, maskfile) -> cursor_args
reads a pair of XBM files into set_cursor arguments

Arguments can either be filenames or filelike objects
with the readlines method. Not largely tested, but
should work with typical XBM files.

       This will search the system fonts for the given font
       name. You can also enable bold or italic styles, and
       the appropriate system font will be selected if available.

       This will always return a valid Font object, and will

       Name can also be a comma separated list of names, in
       which case set of names will be searched in order. Pygame

    Acquire a readable object for a given package name and identifier.
    An IOError will be raised if the resource can not be found.

    For example:
        mydata = getResource('mypkgdata.jpg').read()

    Note that the package name must be fully qualified, if given, such
    that it would be found in sys.modules.

    In some cases, getResource will return a real file object.  In that
    case, it may be useful to use its name attribute to get the path
    rather than use it as a file-like object.  For example, you may
    be handing data off to a C API.
    <module pygame.pkgdata>resource_streamresource_existspackage_or_requirementpkgname/home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pygame/pkgdata.pypkg_resources%s has no __file__!
pkgdata is a simple, extensible way for a package to acquire data file 
resources.

The getResource function is equivalent to the standard idioms, such as
the following minimal implementation:
    
    import sys, os

    def getResource(identifier, pkgname=__name__):
        pkgpath = os.path.dirname(sys.modules[pkgname].__file__)
        path = os.path.join(pkgpath, identifier)
        return file(os.path.normpath(path), mode='rb')

When a __loader__ is present on the module given by __name__, it will defer
getResource to its get_data implementation and return it as a file-like
object (such as StringIO).
pygame.sndarray.use_arraytype (arraytype): return None

    DEPRECATED - only numpy arrays are now supported.
    /home/lyricly/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pygame/sndarray.pypygame.sndarray.samples(Sound): return array

    Reference Sound samples into an array.

    Creates a new array that directly references the samples in a Sound
    object. Modifying the array will change the Sound. The array will
    always be in the format returned from pygame.mixer.get_init().
    pygame.sndarray.get_arraytype (): return str

    DEPRECATED - only numpy arrays are now supported.
    pygame module for accessing sound sample data

Functions to convert between numpy arrays and Sound
objects. This module will only be available when pygame can use the
external numpy package.

Sound data is made of thousands of samples per second, and each sample
is the amplitude of the wave at a particular moment in time. For
example, in 22-kHz format, element number 5 of the array is the
amplitude of the wave after 5/22000 seconds.

Each sample is an 8-bit or 16-bit integer, depending on the data format.
A stereo sound file has two values per sample, while a mono sound file
only has one.

Supported array systems are

  numpy

The array type to use can be changed at runtime using the use_arraytype()
method, which requires one of the above types as string.

Sounds with 16-bit data will be treated as unsigned integers,
if the sound sample type requests this.
<module pygame.sndarray>pygame.sndarray.array(Sound): return array

    Copy Sound samples into an array.

    Creates a new array for the sound data and copies the samples. The
    array will always be in the format returned from
    pygame.mixer.get_init().
    pygame.sndarray.get_arraytypes (): return tuple

    DEPRECATED - only numpy arrays are now supported.
    pygame.sndarray.make_sound(array): return Sound

    Convert an array into a Sound object.
    
    Create a new playable Sound object from an array. The mixer module
    must be initialized and the array format must be similar to the mixer
    audio format.
    set the treshold in milliseconds

        set_timing_treshold(time_ms): return None

        Defaults to 1000.0 / 80.0. This means that the screen will be painted
        using the flip method rather than the update method if the update
        method is taking so long to update the screen that the frame rate falls
        below 80 frames per second.

        a more featureful subclass of Sprite with more attributes

    pygame.sprite.DirtySprite(*groups): return DirtySprite

    Extra DirtySprite attributes with their default values:

    dirty = 1
        If set to 1, it is repainted and then set to 0 again.
        If set to 2, it is always dirty (repainted each frame;
        flag is not reset).
        If set to 0, it is not dirty and therefore not repainted again.

    blendmode = 0
        It's the special_flags argument of Surface.blit; see the blendmodes in
        the Surface.blit documentation

    source_rect = None
        This is the source rect to use. Remember that it is relative to the top
        left corner (0, 0) of self.image.

    visible = 1
        Normally this is 1. If set to 0, it will not be repainted. (If you
        change visible to 1, you must set dirty to 1 for it to be erased from
        the screen.)

    _layer = 0
        0 is the default value but this is able to be set differently
        when subclassing.

    LayeredDirty Group is for DirtySprites; subclasses LayeredUpdates

    pygame.sprite.LayeredDirty(*spites, **kwargs): return LayeredDirty

    This group requires pygame.sprite.DirtySprite or any sprite that
    has the following attributes:
        image, rect, dirty, visible, blendmode (see doc of DirtySprite).

    It uses the dirty flag technique and is therefore faster than
    pygame.sprite.RenderUpdates if you have many static sprites.  It
    also switches automatically between dirty rect updating and full
    screen drawing, so you do no have to worry which would be faster.

    As with the pygame.sprite.Group, you can specify some additional attributes
    through kwargs:
        _use_update: True/False   (default is False)
        _default_layer: default layer where the sprites without a layer are
            added
        _time_threshold: treshold time for switching between dirty rect mode
            and fullscreen mode; defaults to updating at 80 frames per second,
            which is equal to 1000.0 / 80.0

    New in pygame 1.8.0

    collide_rectcontainer class for many Sprites

    pygame.sprite.Group(*sprites): return Group

    A simple container for Sprite objects. This class can be subclassed to
    create containers with more specific behaviors. The constructor takes any
    number of Sprite arguments to add to the Group. The group supports the
    following standard Python operations:

        in      test if a Sprite is contained
        len     the number of Sprites contained
        bool    test if any Sprites are contained
        iter    iterate through all the Sprites

    The Sprites in the Group are not ordered, so the Sprites are drawn and
    iterated over in no particular order.

    OrderedUpdatesreturn the visible value of that spriteadd sprite(s) to group

        Group.add(sprite, list, group, ...): return None

        Adds a sprite or sequence of sprites to a group.

        LayeredDirty.repaint_rect_set_spriteLayeredDirty.clearsprites_appendcreate a new collide_rect_ratio callable

        Ratio is expected to be a floating point value used to scale
        the underlying sprite rect before checking for collisions.

        sprites_layersSprite.addSprite.alive_Sprite__ghas_internalbring the sprite to front layer

        LayeredUpdates.move_to_front(sprite): return None

        Brings the sprite to front by changing the sprite layer to the top-most
        layer. The sprite is added at the end of the list of sprites in that
        top-most layer.

        LayeredUpdates Group handles layers, which are drawn like OrderedUpdates

    pygame.sprite.LayeredUpdates(*spites, **kwargs): return LayeredUpdates

        base class for containers of sprites

    AbstractGroup does everything needed to behave as a normal group. You can
    easily subclass a new group class from this or the other groups below if
    you want to add more features.

    Any AbstractGroup-derived sprite groups act like sequences and support
    iteration, len, and so on.

    LayeredUpdates.layersA callable class that checks for collisions using scaled rects

    The class checks for collisions between two sprites using a scaled version
    of the sprites' rects. Is created with a ratio; the instance is then
    intended to be passed as a collided callback function to the *collide
    functions.

    collisions, then this returns None.

    If you don't need all the features of the spritecollide function, this
    function will be a bit quicker.

    Collided is a callback function used to calculate if two sprites are
    colliding. It should take two sprites as values and return a bool value
    indicating if they are colliding. If collided is not passed, then all
    sprites must have a "rect" value, which is a rectangle of the sprite area,
    which will be used to calculate the collision.


    simple base class for visible game objects

    pygame.sprite.Sprite(*groups): return Sprite

    The base class for visible game objects. Derived classes will want to
    override the Sprite.update() method and assign Sprite.image and Sprite.rect
    attributes.  The initializer can accept any number of Group instances that
    the Sprite will become a member of.

    When subclassing the Sprite class, be sure to call the base initializer
    before adding the Sprite to Groups.

    AbstractGroup.emptyLayeredUpdates.change_layerswitch_layerlostspritesLayeredUpdates.get_sprites_atAbstractGroup.copy_spritegroup      )@Sprite.__init__pygame module with basic game object classes

This module contains several simple classes to be used within games. There
are the main Sprite class and several Group classes that contain Sprites.
The use of these classes is entirely optional when using Pygame. The classes
are fairly lightweight and only provide a starting place for the code
that is common to most games.

The Sprite class is intended to be used as a base class for the different
types of objects in the game. There is also a base Group class that simply
stores sprites. A game could create new types of Group classes that operate
on specially customized Sprite instances they contain.

The basic Sprite class can draw the Sprites it contains to a Surface. The
Group.draw() method requires that each Sprite have a Surface.image attribute
and a Surface.rect. The Group.clear() method requires these same attributes
and can be used to erase all the Sprites with background. There are also
more advanced Groups: pygame.sprite.RenderUpdates() and
pygame.sprite.OrderedUpdates().

Lastly, this module contains several collision functions. These help find
sprites inside multiple groups that have intersecting bounding rectangles.
To find the collisions, the Sprites are required to have a Surface.rect
attribute assigned.

The groups are designed for high efficiency in removing and adding Sprites
to them. They also allow cheap testing to see if a Sprite already exists in
a Group. A given Sprite can exist in any number of groups. A game could use
some groups to control object rendering, and a completely separate set of
groups to control interaction or player movement. Instead of adding type
attributes or bools to a derived Sprite class, consider keeping the
Sprites inside organized Groups. This will allow for easier lookup later
in the game.

Sprites and Groups manage their relationships with the add() and remove()
methods. These methods can accept a single or multiple group arguments for
membership.  The default initializers for these classes also take a
single group or list of groups as argments for initial membership. It is safe
to repeatedly add and remove the same Sprite from a Group.

While it is possible to design sprite and group classes that don't derive
from the Sprite and AbstractGroup classes below, it is strongly recommended
that you extend those when you create a new Sprite or Group class.

Sprites are not thread safe, so lock them yourself if using threads.

    Return a list containing all Sprites in a Group that intersect with another
    Sprite. Intersection is determined by comparing the Sprite.rect attribute
    of each Sprite.

    The dokill argument is a bool. If set to True, all Sprites that collide
    will be removed from the Group.

    The collided argument is a callback function used to calculate if two
    sprites are colliding. it should take two sprites as values, and return a
    bool value indicating if they are colliding. If collided is not passed, all
    sprites must have a "rect" value, which is a rectangle of the sprite area,

    pygame.sprite.OrderedUpdates(*spites): return OrderedUpdates

    This class derives from pygame.sprite.RenderUpdates().  It maintains
    the order in which the Sprites were added to the Group for rendering.
    This makes adding and removing Sprites from the Group a little
    slower than regular Groups.

    OrderedUpdates.spritesdetect collision between two sprites using scaled circles

        pygame.sprite.collide_circle_radio(ratio)(left, right): return bool

        Tests for collision between two sprites by testing whether two circles
        centered on the sprites overlap after scaling the circle's radius by
        the stored ratio. If the sprites have a "radius" attribute, that is
        used to create the circle; otherwise, a circle is created that is big
        enough to completely enclose the sprite's rect as given by the "rect"
        attribute. Intended to be passed as a collided callback function to the
        *collide functions. Sprites must have a "rect" and an optional "radius"
        attribute.

        You can set the default layer through kwargs using 'default_layer'
        and an integer for the layer. The default layer is 0.

        If the sprite you add has an attribute _layer, then that layer will be
        used. If **kwarg contains 'layer', then the passed sprites will be
        added to that layer (overriding the sprite._layer attribute). If
        neither the sprite nor **kwarg has a 'layer', then the default layer is
        used to add the sprites.

        creates a new collide_circle_ratio callable instance

        The given ratio is expected to be a floating point value used to scale
        the underlying sprite radius before checking for collisions.

        When the ratio is ratio=1.0, then it behaves exactly like the 
        collide_circle method.

        AbstractGroup.hasreturn the sprite at the index idx from the groups sprites

        Sprite.update(*args):

        The default implementation of this method does nothing; it's just a
        convenient "hook" that you can override. This method is called by
        Group.update() with whatever arguments you give it.

        There is no need to use this method if not using the convenience
        method by the same name in the Group class.

    Given two groups, this will find the intersections between all sprites in
    each group. It returns a dictionary of all sprites in the first group that
    collide. The value for each item in the dictionary is a list of the sprites
    in the second group it collides with. The two dokill arguments control if
    the sprites from either group will be automatically removed from all
    groups. Collided is a callback function used to calculate if two sprites
    are colliding. it should take two sprites as values, and return a bool

Every pixel is stored as a single integer value to represent the red,
green, and blue colors. The 8bit images use a value that looks into a
colormap. Pixels with higher depth use a bit packing process to place
three or four values into a single number.

The arrays are indexed by the X axis first, followed by the Y
axis. Arrays that treat the pixels as a single integer are referred to
as 2D arrays. This module can also separate the red, green, and blue
color values into separate indices. These types of arrays are referred
to as 3D arrays, and the last index is 0 for red, 1 for green, and 2 for
blue.

Supported array types are

  numpy
  numeric (deprecated; will be removed in Pygame 1.9.3.)

The default will be numpy, if installed. Otherwise, Numeric will be set
as default if installed, and a deprecation warning will be issued. If
neither numpy nor Numeric are installed, the module will raise an
ImportError.

The array type to use can be changed at runtime using the use_arraytype()
method, which requires one of the above types as string.

Note: numpy and Numeric are not completely compatible. Certain array
manipulations, which work for one type, might behave differently or even
completely break for the other.

Additionally, in contrast to Numeric, numpy does use unsigned 16-bit
integers. Images with 16-bit data will be treated as unsigned
integers. Numeric instead uses signed integers for the representation,
which is important to keep in mind, if you use the module's functions
and wonder about the values.

       This will search the system fonts for the given font

       the appropriate system font will be selected if available.

       This will always return a valid Font object, and will
       fallback on the builtin pygame font if the given font
       is not found.

       Name can also be a comma separated list of names, in
       which case set of names will be searched in order. Pygame
       uses a small set of common font aliases, if the specific
       font you ask for is not available, a reasonable alternative
       may be used.

       if optional contructor is provided, it must be a function with

        Add one or more parse actions to expression's list of parse actions. See :class:`setParseAction`.

        See examples in :class:`copy`.
        tmptokensisequalfile_or_filenameparseAllfile_contents_defaultExceptionDebugActionKatakanasingleArgBuiltinstry_not_enderParserElement.copyHelper to create a validating parse action to be used with start
    tags created with :class:`makeXMLTags` or
    :class:`makeHTMLTags`. Use ``withAttribute`` to qualify
    a starting tag with a required attribute value, to avoid false
    matches on common tags such as ``<TD>`` or ``<DIV>``.

    Call ``withAttribute`` with a series of attribute names and
    values. Specify the list of filter attributes names and values as:

     - keyword arguments, as in ``(align="right")``, or
     - as an explicit dict with ``**`` operator, when an attribute
       name is also a Python reserved word, as in ``**{"class":"Customer", "align":"right"}``
     - a list of name-value tuples, as in ``(("ns1:class", "Customer"), ("ns2:align","right"))``

    For attribute names with a namespace prefix, you must use the second
    form.  Attribute names are matched insensitive to upper/lower case.

    If just testing for ``class`` (with or without a namespace), use
    :class:`withClass`.

    To verify that the attribute exists, but without specifying a value,
    pass ``withAttribute.ANY_VALUE`` as the value.

    Example::

        html = '''
            <div>
            Some text
            <div type="grid">1 4 0 1 0</div>

            <div>this has no type</div>
            </div>

        '''
        div,div_end = makeHTMLTags("div")

        # only match div tag having a type attribute with value "grid"
        div_grid = div().setParseAction(withAttribute(type="grid"))
        grid_expr = div_grid + SkipTo(div | div_end)("body")
        for grid_header in grid_expr.searchString(html):
            print(grid_header.body)

        # construct a match with any div tag having a type attribute, regardless of the value
        div_any_type = div().setParseAction(withAttribute(type=withAttribute.ANY_VALUE))
        div_expr = div_any_type + SkipTo(div | div_end)("body")
        for div_header in div_expr.searchString(html):
            print(div_header.body)

    prints::

        Implementation of * operator, allows use of ``expr * 3`` in place of
        ``expr + expr + expr``.  Expressions may also me multiplied by a 2-integer
        tuple, similar to ``{min,max}`` multipliers in regular expressions.  Tuples
        may also include ``None`` as in:
         - ``expr*(n,None)`` or ``expr*(n,)`` is equivalent
              to ``expr*n + ZeroOrMore(expr)``
              (read as "at least n instances of ``expr``")
         - ``expr*(None,n)`` is equivalent to ``expr*(0,n)``
              (read as "0 to n instances of ``expr``")
         - ``expr*(None,None)`` is equivalent to ``ZeroOrMore(expr)``
         - ``expr*(1,None)`` is equivalent to ``OneOrMore(expr)``

        Note that ``expr*(None,n)`` does not raise an exception if
        more than n exprs exist in the input stream; that is,
        ``expr*(None,n)`` does not enforce a maximum number of expr
        occurrences.  If this behavior is desired, then write
        ``expr*(None,n) + ~expr``

    closing delimiters ("(" and ")" are the default).

    Parameters:
     - opener - opening character for a nested list
       (default= ``"("``); can also be a pyparsing expression
     - closer - closing character for a nested list
       (default= ``")"``); can also be a pyparsing expression
     - content - expression for items within the nested lists
       (default= ``None``)
     - ignoreExpr - expression for ignoring opening and closing
       delimiters (default= :class:`quotedString`)

    If an expression is not provided for the content argument, the
    nested expression will capture all whitespace-delimited content
    between delimiters as a list of separate values.

    Use the ``ignoreExpr`` argument to define expressions that may
    contain opening or closing characters that should not be treated as
    opening or closing characters for nesting, such as quotedString or
    a comment expression.  Specify multiple expressions using an
    :class:`Or` or :class:`MatchFirst`. The default is
    :class:`quotedString`, but if no expressions are to be ignored, then
    pass ``None`` for this argument.

    Paul McGuire <ptmcg@users.sourceforge.net>opAssocConverter to return a repetitive expression as a list, but also
    as a dictionary. Each element can also be referenced using the first
    token in the expression as its key. Useful for tabular report
    scraping when the first column can be used as a item key.

    Example::

        data_word = Word(alphas)
        label = data_word + FollowedBy(':')
        attr_expr = Group(label + Suppress(':') + OneOrMore(data_word).setParseAction(' '.join))

        print(OneOrMore(attr_expr).parseString(text).dump())

        # instead of OneOrMore(expr), parse using Dict(OneOrMore(Group(expr))) - Dict will auto-assign names
        result = Dict(OneOrMore(Group(attr_expr))).parseString(text)

    ParserElement.__ne__Token for skipping over all undefined text until the matched
    expression is found.

    Parameters:
     - expr - target expression marking the end of the data to be skipped
     - include - (default= ``False``) if True, the target expression is also parsed
          (the skipped text and target expression are returned as a 2-element list).
     - ignore - (default= ``None``) used to define grammars (typically quoted strings and
          comments) that might contain false matches to the target expression
     - failOn - (default= ``None``) define expressions that are not allowed to be
          included in the skipped test; if found before the target expression is found,
          the SkipTo is not a match

        Implementation of + operator - returns :class:`And`. Adding strings to a ParserElement
        converts them to :class:`Literal`s by default.

        Example::

            hello = "Hello, World!"

        Token for matching words composed of characters *not* in a given
    set (will include whitespace in matched characters if not listed in
    the provided exclusion set - see example). Defined with string
    containing all disallowed characters, and an optional minimum,
    maximum, and/or exact length.  The default value for ``min`` is
    1 (a minimum value < 1 is not valid); the default values for
    ``max`` and ``exact`` are 0, meaning no maximum or exact
    length restriction.

    Example::

        # define a comma-separated-value as anything that is not a ','
        csv_value = CharsNotIn(',')
        print(delimitedList(csv_value).parseString("dkls,lsdkjf,s12 34,@!#,213"))

        cannot multiply 'ParserElement' and ('%s','%s') objectsC style commentParseResults.__getnewargs__
        Define one or more actions to perform when successfully matching parse element definition.
        Parse action fn is a callable method with 0-3 arguments, called as ``fn(s,loc,toks)`` ,
        ``fn(loc,toks)`` , ``fn(toks)`` , or just ``fn()`` , where:

        - s   = the original string being parsed (see note below)
        - loc = the location of the matching substring
        - toks = a list of the matched tokens, packaged as a :class:`ParseResults` object

        If the functions in fns modify the tokens, they can return them as the return
        value from fn, and the modified list of tokens will replace the original.
        Otherwise, fn does not need to return any value.

        Optional keyword arguments:
        - callDuringTry = (default= ``False`` ) indicate if parse action should be run during lookaheads and alternate testing

        Note: the default parsing behavior is to expand tabs in the input string
        before starting the parsing process.  See :class:`parseString for more
        information on parsing strings containing ``<TAB>`` s, and suggested
        methods to maintain a consistent view of the parsed string, the parse
        location, and line and column positions within the parsed string.

        Example::

            integer = Word(nums)
            date_str = integer + '/' + integer + '/' + integer

            date_str.parseString("1999/12/31")  # -> ['1999', '/', '12', '/', '31']

            # use parse action to convert to ints at parse time
            integer = Word(nums).setParseAction(lambda toks: int(toks[0]))
            date_str = integer + '/' + integer + '/' + integer

            # note that integer fields are now ints, not strings
            date_str.parseString("1999/12/31")  # -> [1999, '/', 12, '/', 31]

        Returns the parse results as a nested list of matching tokens, all converted to strings.

        Example::

            patt = OneOrMore(Word(alphas))
            result = patt.parseString("sldkj lsdkj sldkj")
            # even though the result prints in string-like form, it is actually a pyparsing ParseResults
            print(type(result), result) # -> <class 'pyparsing.ParseResults'> ['sldkj', 'lsdkj', 'sldkj']

            # Use asList() to create an actual list
            result_list = result.asList()
            print(type(result_list), result_list) # -> <class 'list'> ['sldkj', 'lsdkj', 'sldkj']
        
    A set of Unicode characters, for language-specific strings for
    ``alphas``, ``nums``, ``alphanums``, and ``printables``.
    A unicode_set is defined by a list of ranges in the Unicode character
    set, in a class attribute ``_ranges``, such as::

        _ranges = [(0x0020, 0x007e), (0x00a0, 0x00ff),]

    A unicode set can also be defined using multiple inheritance of other unicode sets::

            pass

        Enable display of debugging messages while doing pattern matching.
        Set ``flag`` to True to enable, False to disable.

        Example::

            wd = Word(alphas).setName("alphaword")
            integer = Word(nums).setName("numword")
            term = wd | integer

            # turn on debugging for wd
            wd.setDebug()

            OneOrMore(term).parseString("abc 123 xyz 890")

        prints::

            Match alphaword at loc 0(1,1)
            Matched alphaword -> ['abc']
            Match alphaword at loc 3(1,4)
            Exception raised:Expected alphaword (at char 4), (line:1, col:5)
            Match alphaword at loc 7(1,8)

            Exception raised:Expected alphaword (at char 12), (line:1, col:13)
            Match alphaword at loc 15(1,16)
            Exception raised:Expected alphaword (at char 15), (line:1, col:16)

        The output shown is that produced by the default debug actions - custom debug actions can be
        specified using :class:`setDebugActions`. Prior to attempting
        to match the ``wd`` expression, the debugging message ``"Match <exprname> at loc <n>(<line>,<col>)"``
        is shown. Then if the parse succeeds, a ``"Matched"`` message is shown, or an ``"Exception raised"``
        message is shown. Also note the use of :class:`setName` to assign a human-readable name to the expression,
        which makes debugging and exception messages easier to understand - for instance, the default
        name created for the :class:`Word` expression without calling ``setName`` is ``"W:(ABCD...)"``.
        Token to match a specified string, ignoring case of letters.
    Note: the matched results will always be in the case of the given
    match string, NOT the case of the input text.

    Example::

        OneOrMore(CaselessLiteral("CMD")).parseString("cmd CMD Cmd10") # -> ['CMD', 'CMD', 'CMD']

    (Contrast with example for :class:`CaselessKeyword`.)
    minLenParseResults.clear[%s][%s]*Matches if current position is at the beginning of a line within

          AAA but not this one
        B AAA and definitely not this one
        '''

        for t in (LineStart() + 'AAA' + restOfLine).searchString(test):

    Token for matching strings that are delimited by quoting characters.

    Defined with the following parameters:

        - quoteChar - string of one or more characters defining the
          quote delimiting string
        - escChar - character to escape quotes, typically backslash
          (default= ``None`` )
        - escQuote - special quote sequence to escape an embedded quote
          string (such as SQL's ``""`` to escape an embedded ``"``)
          (default= ``None`` )
        - multiline - boolean indicating whether quotes can span
          multiple lines (default= ``False`` )
        - unquoteResults - boolean indicating whether the matched text
          should be unquoted (default= ``True`` )
        - endQuoteChar - string of one or more characters defining the
          end of the quote delimited string (default= ``None``  => same as
          quoteChar)
        - convertWhitespaceEscapes - convert escaped whitespace
          (``'\t'``, ``'\n'``, etc.) to actual whitespace
          (default= ``True`` )

    Example::

        qs = QuotedString('"')
        print(qs.searchString('lsjdf "This is the quote" sldjf'))
        complex_qs = QuotedString('{{', endQuoteChar='}}')

    keyword string:

     - ``identChars`` is a string of characters that would be valid
       identifier characters, defaulting to all alphanumerics + "_" and
       "$"
     - ``caseless`` allows case-insensitive matching, default is ``False``.

    Example::

        Keyword("start").parseString("start")  # -> ['start']
        Keyword("start").parseString("starting")  # -> Exception

    For case-insensitive matching, use :class:`CaselessKeyword`.

           Repeated parse attempts at the same string location (which happens
           often in many complex grammars) can immediately return a cached value,
           instead of re-executing parsing/validating code.  Memoizing is done of
           both valid results and parsing exceptions.

           Parameters:

           - cache_size_limit - (default= ``128``) - if an integer value is provided
             will limit the size of the packrat cache; if None is passed, then
             the cache size will be unbounded; if 0 is passed, the cache will
             be effectively disabled.

           This speedup may break existing programs that use parse actions that
           have side-effects.  For this reason, packrat parsing is disabled when
           you first import pyparsing.  To activate the packrat feature, your
           program must call the class method :class:`ParserElement.enablePackrat`.
           For best results, call ``enablePackrat()`` immediately after
           importing pyparsing.

           Example::

               import pyparsing
               pyparsing.ParserElement.enablePackrat()
        null string passed to Literal; use Empty() instead_MultipleMatch.__init__
        Method to take an exception and translate the Python internal traceback into a list
        of the pyparsing expressions that caused the exception to be raised.

        Parameters:

         - exc - exception raised during parsing (need not be a ParseException, in support
           of Python exceptions that might be raised in a parse action)
         - depth (default=16) - number of levels back in the stack trace to list expression
           and function names; if None, the full stack trace names will be listed; if 0, only
           the failing input line, marker, and exception string will be shown

        Returns a multi-line string listing the ParserElements and/or function names in the
        exception's stack trace.

        Note: the diagnostic output will include string representations of the expressions
        that failed to parse. These representations will be more helpful if you use `setName` to
        give identifiable names to your expressions. Otherwise they will use the default string
        forms, which may be cryptic to read.

pyparsing module - Classes and methods to define and execute parsing grammars
=============================================================================

The pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and
executing simple grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or the
use of regular expressions.  With pyparsing, you don't need to learn
a new syntax for defining grammars or matching expressions - the parsing
module provides a library of classes that you use to construct the
grammar directly in Python.

Here is a program to parse "Hello, World!" (or any greeting of the form
``"<salutation>, <addressee>!"``), built up using :class:`Word`,
:class:`Literal`, and :class:`And` elements
(the :class:`'+'<ParserElement.__add__>` operators create :class:`And` expressions,
and the strings are auto-converted to :class:`Literal` expressions)::

    from pyparsing import Word, alphas

    # define grammar of a greeting
    greet = Word(alphas) + "," + Word(alphas) + "!"

    hello = "Hello, World!"
    print (hello, "->", greet.parseString(hello))

The program outputs the following::

    Hello, World! -> ['Hello', ',', 'World', '!']

The Python representation of the grammar is quite readable, owing to the
self-explanatory class names, and the use of '+', '|' and '^' operators.

The :class:`ParseResults` object returned from
:class:`ParserElement.parseString` can be
accessed as a nested list, a dictionary, or an object with named
attributes.

The pyparsing module handles some of the problems that are typically
vexing when writing text parsers:

  - extra or missing whitespace (the above program will also handle
    "Hello,World!", "Hello  ,  World  !", etc.)
  - quoted strings
  - embedded comments


Getting Started -
-----------------
Visit the classes :class:`ParserElement` and :class:`ParseResults` to
see the base classes that most other pyparsing
classes inherit from. Use the docstrings for examples of how to:

 - construct literal match expressions from :class:`Literal` and
   :class:`CaselessLiteral` classes
 - construct character word-group expressions using the :class:`Word`
   class
 - see how to create repetitive expressions using :class:`ZeroOrMore`
   and :class:`OneOrMore` classes
 - use :class:`'+'<And>`, :class:`'|'<MatchFirst>`, :class:`'^'<Or>`,
   and :class:`'&'<Each>` operators to combine simple expressions into
   more complex ones
 - associate names with your parsed results using
   :class:`ParserElement.setResultsName`
 - find some helpful expression short-cuts like :class:`delimitedList`
   and :class:`oneOf`
 - find more useful common expressions in the :class:`pyparsing_common`
   namespace class
_defaultSuccessDebugActionQuotedString.__str__asStringParserElement._parseNoCacheNo match found for tokenlistSimplified version of :class:`withAttribute` when
    matching on a div class - made difficult because ``class`` is
    a reserved word in Python.

    Example::

        html = '''
            <div>
            Some text
            <div class="grid">1 4 0 1 0</div>
            <div class="graph">1,3 2,3 1,1</div>
            <div>this &lt;div&gt; has no class</div>
            </div>

        '''
        div,div_end = makeHTMLTags("div")
        div_grid = div().setParseAction(withClass("grid"))

        grid_expr = div_grid + SkipTo(div | div_end)("body")
        for grid_header in grid_expr.searchString(html):
            print(grid_header.body)

        div_any_type = div().setParseAction(withClass(withAttribute.ANY_VALUE))
        div_expr = div_any_type + SkipTo(div | div_end)("body")
        for div_header in div_expr.searchString(html):
            print(div_header.body)

    prints::

        1 4 0 1 0

        1 4 0 1 0
        1,3 2,3 1,1
    Group.postParseReturns current line number within a string, counting newlines as line separators.
    The first line is number 1.

    Note - the default parsing behavior is to expand tabs in the input string
    before starting the parsing process.  See :class:`ParserElement.parseString`
    for more information on parsing strings containing ``<TAB>`` s, and
    suggested methods to maintain a consistent view of the parsed string, the
    parse location, and line and column positions within the parsed string.
    StringEnd.parseImplsglQuotedStringParserElement.split_ParseResults__doinitParserElement.canParseNextParserElement.__rne__Requires that at least one :class:`ParseExpression` is found. If
    two expressions match, the first one listed is the one that will
    match. May be constructed using the ``'|'`` operator.

    Example::

        # construct MatchFirst using '|' operator

        # watch the order of expressions to match
        number = Word(nums) | Combine(Word(nums) + '.' + Word(nums))
        print(number.searchString("123 3.1416 789")) #  Fail! -> [['123'], ['3'], ['1416'], ['789']]

        # put more selective expression first
        number = Combine(Word(nums) + '.' + Word(nums)) | Word(nums)
        print(number.searchString("123 3.1416 789")) #  Better -> [['123'], ['3.1416'], ['789']]
    í•œêµ­ì–´WordStart.parseImplendQuoteCharLenTokenConverter.__init__C++ style commentunicode string literaltoknrest of lineParserElement._skipIgnorables
        Inserts new element at location index in the list of parsed tokens.

        Similar to ``list.insert()``.

        Example::

            print(OneOrMore(Word(nums)).parseString("0 123 321")) # -> ['0', '123', '321']

            # use a parse action to insert the parse location in the front of the parsed results
            def insert_locn(locn, tokens):
                tokens.insert(0, locn)
            print(OneOrMore(Word(nums)).addParseAction(insert_locn).parseString("0 123 321")) # -> [0, '0', '123', '321']
        RIGHTHelper to decorate a returned token with its starting and ending
    locations in the input string.

    This helper adds the following results names:

     - locn_start = location where matched expression begins
     - locn_end = location where matched expression ends
     - value = the actual parsed results

    Be careful if the input text contains ``<TAB>`` characters, you
    may want to call :class:`ParserElement.parseWithTabs`

    Example::

        wd = Word(alphas)
        for match in locatedExpr(wd).searchString("ljsdf123lksdjjf123lkkjj1222"):
            print(match)

    prints::

        [[0, 'ljsdf', 5]]
        [[8, 'lksdjjf', 15]]
        [[18, 'lkkjj', 23]]

        Execute the parse expression with the given string.
        This is the main interface to the client code, once the complete
        expression has been built.

        If you want the grammar to require that the entire input string be
        successfully parsed, then set ``parseAll`` to True (equivalent to ending
        the grammar with ``StringEnd()``).

        Note: ``parseString`` implicitly calls ``expandtabs()`` on the input string,
        in order to report proper column numbers in parse actions.
        If the input string contains tabs and
        the grammar uses parse actions that use the ``loc`` argument to index into the
        string being parsed, you can ensure you have a consistent view of the input
        string by:

        - calling ``parseWithTabs`` on your grammar before calling ``parseString``
          (see :class:`parseWithTabs`)
        - define your parse action using the full ``(s,loc,toks)`` signature, and
          reference the input string using the parse action's ``s`` argument
        - explictly expand the tabs in your input string before calling
          ``parseString``

        Example::

            Word('a').parseString('aaaaabaaa')  # -> ['aaaaa']
            Word('a').parseString('aaaaabaaa', parseAll=True)  # -> Exception: Expected end of text

            result = date_str.parseString('12/31/1999')
            print(type(result), repr(result)) # -> <class 'pyparsing.ParseResults'> (['12', '/', '31', '/', '1999'], {'day': [('1999', 4)], 'year': [('12', 0)], 'month': [('31', 2)]})

            result_dict = result.asDict()
            print(type(result_dict), repr(result_dict)) # -> <class 'dict'> {'day': '1999', 'year': '12', 'month': '31'}

            # even though a ParseResults supports dict-like access, sometime you just need to have a dict
            import json
            print(json.dumps(result)) # -> Exception: TypeError: ... is not JSON serializable
            print(json.dumps(result.asDict())) # -> {"month": "31", "day": "1999", "year": "12"}
        ZeroOrMore.__init__ParseResults.__new__Helper method for common parse actions that simply return
    a literal value.  Especially useful when used with

    When the expression is known, it is assigned to the ``Forward``
    variable using the '<<' operator.

    Note: take care when assigning to ``Forward`` not to overlook
    precedence of operators.

    Specifically, '|' has a lower precedence than '<<', so that::

        fwdExpr << a | b | c

    will actually be evaluated as::

        (fwdExpr << a) | b | c

    thereby leaving b and c out as parseable alternatives.  It is recommended that you
    explicitly group the values inserted into the ``Forward``::

        fwdExpr << (a | b | c)

    Converting to use the '<<=' operator instead will avoid this problem.

    See :class:`ParseResults.pprint` for an example of a recursive
    parser created using ``Forward``.

     - stopOn - (default= ``None``) - expression for a terminating sentinel

        label = data_word + FollowedBy(':')
        attr_expr = Group(label + Suppress(':') + OneOrMore(data_word).setParseAction(' '.join))

        second = matchPreviousExpr(first)
        matchExpr = first + ":" + second

    will match ``"1:1"``, but not ``"1:2"``.  Because this
    matches by expressions, will *not* match the leading ``"1:1"``
    in ``"1:10"``; the expressions are evaluated first, and then
    compared, so ``"1"`` is compared with ``"10"``. Do *not* use

        Make a copy of this :class:`ParserElement`.  Useful for defining
        different parse actions for the same parsing pattern, using copies of
        the original parse element.

        Example::

            integer = Word(nums).setParseAction(lambda toks: int(toks[0]))
            integerK = integer.copy().addParseAction(lambda toks: toks[0]*1024) + Suppress("K")
            integerM = integer.copy().addParseAction(lambda toks: toks[0]*1024*1024) + Suppress("M")

            print(OneOrMore(integerK | integerM | integer).parseString("5K 100 640K 256M"))

        prints::

            [5120, 100, 655360, 268435456]

        Equivalent form of ``expr.copy()`` is just ``expr()``::

    tokensStart|(?:%s.)Unicode set for Chinese Unicode Character Range
        Extension to :class:`scanString`, to modify matching text with modified tokens that may
        be returned from a parse action.  To use ``transformString``, define a grammar and
        attach a parse action to it that modifies the returned token list.
        Invoking ``transformString()`` on a target string will then scan for matches,
        and replace the matched text patterns according to the logic in the parse
        action.  ``transformString()`` returns the resulting transformed string.

        Example::

            wd = Word(alphas)
            wd.setParseAction(lambda toks: toks[0].title())

            print(wd.transformString("now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york."))

        Each test string must be on a single line. If you want to test a string that spans multiple
        lines, create a test like this::

            expr.runTest(r"this is a test\n of strings that spans \n 3 lines")

        (Note that this is a raw string literal, you must include the leading 'r'.)

    such as those used to define block statements in Python source code.

    Parameters:

     - blockStatementExpr - expression defining syntax of statement that
       is repeated within the indented block
     - indentStack - list created by caller to manage indentation stack
       (multiple statementWithIndentedBlock expressions within a single

     - indent - boolean indicating whether block must be indented beyond
       the the current level; set to False for block of left-most
       statements (default= ``True``)

    A valid block must contain at least one ``blockStatement``.

    White.__init__.<locals>.<genexpr>Returns current column within a string, counting newlines as line separators.
   The first column is number 1.

   Note: the default parsing behavior is to expand tabs in the input string
   before starting the parsing process.  See
   :class:`ParserElement.parseString` for more
   information on parsing strings containing ``<TAB>`` s, and suggested
   methods to maintain a consistent view of the parsed string, the parse
   location, and line and column positions within the parsed string.
   ~{Unmatchable tokenParserElement.scanString
        Diagnostic method for listing out the contents of
        a :class:`ParseResults`. Accepts an optional ``indent`` argument so
        that this string can be embedded in a nested display of other data.

        Example::

            integer = Word(nums)
            date_str = integer("year") + '/' + integer("month") + '/' + integer("day")

            result = date_str.parseString('12/31/1999')
            print(result.dump())

        prints::

            ['12', '/', '31', '/', '1999']
            - day: 1999
            - month: 31
            - year: 12
        Helper to return the original, untokenized text for a given
    expression.  Useful to restore the parsed fields of an HTML start
    tag into the raw tag text itself, or to revert separate tokens with
    intervening whitespace back to the original matching input text. By
    default, returns astring containing the original parsed text.

    If the optional ``asString`` argument is passed as
    ``False``, then the return value is
    a :class:`ParseResults` containing any results names that
    were originally matched, and a single token containing the original
    matched text from the input string.  So if the expression passed to
    :class:`originalTextFor` contains expressions with defined
    results names, you must set ``asString`` to ``False`` if you
    want to preserve those results name values.

    Example::

        src = "this is test <b> bold <i>text</i> </b> normal text "
        for tag in ("b","i"):
            opener,closer = makeHTMLTags(tag)
            patt = originalTextFor(opener + SkipTo(closer) + closer)
            print(patt.searchString(src)[0])

    prints::

        ['<b> bold <i>text</i> </b>']
        ['<i>text</i>']
    indentedBlock.<locals>.reset_stackLEFTLookahead to disallow matching with the given parse expression.
    ``NotAny`` does *not* advance the parsing position within the
    input string, it only verifies that the specified parse expression
    does *not* match at the current position.  Also, ``NotAny`` does
    *not* skip over leading whitespace. ``NotAny`` always returns
    a null token list.  May be constructed using the '~' operator.

    Example::

        AND, OR, NOT = map(CaselessKeyword, "AND OR NOT".split())

        # take care not to mistake keywords for identifiers
        ident = ~(AND | OR | NOT) + Word(alphas)
        boolean_term = Optional(NOT) + ident

        # very crude boolean expression - to support parenthesis groups and
        # operation hierarchy, use infixNotation
        boolean_expr = boolean_term + ZeroOrMore((AND | OR) + boolean_term)

        # integers that are followed by "." are actually floats
        integer = Word(nums) + ~Char(".")
    Parse action to remove HTML tags from web page HTML source

        Example::

            # strip HTML links from normal text
            text = '<td>More info at the <a href="https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/wiki">pyparsing</a> wiki page</td>'
            td,td_end = makeHTMLTags("TD")
            table_text = td + SkipTo(td_end).setParseAction(pyparsing_common.stripHTMLTags)("body") + td_end
            print(table_text.parseString(text).body)

        Or.__str__.<locals>.<genexpr>Helper to easily and clearly define a dictionary by specifying
    the respective patterns for the key and value.  Takes care of
    defining the :class:`Dict`, :class:`ZeroOrMore`, and
    :class:`Group` tokens in the proper order.  The key pattern
    can include delimiting markers or punctuation, as long as they are
    suppressed, thereby leaving the significant key text.  The value
    pattern can include named results, so that the :class:`Dict` results
    can include named token fields.

    Example::

        text = "shape: SQUARE posn: upper left color: light blue texture: burlap"
        attr_expr = (label + Suppress(':') + OneOrMore(data_word, stopOn=label).setParseAction(' '.join))
        print(OneOrMore(attr_expr).parseString(text).dump())

        attr_label = label
        attr_value = Suppress(':') + OneOrMore(data_word, stopOn=label).setParseAction(' '.join)

        # similar to Dict, but simpler call format
        result = dictOf(attr_label, attr_value).parseString(text)
        print(result.dump())
        print(result['shape'])
        print(result.shape)  # object attribute access works too
        print(result.asDict())

    prints::

        [['shape', 'SQUARE'], ['posn', 'upper left'], ['color', 'light blue'], ['texture', 'burlap']]
        - color: light blue
        - posn: upper left

    Expected %r (with up to %d mismatches)Helper to construct opening and closing tag expressions for HTML,
    given a tag name. Matches tags in either upper or lower case,
    attributes with namespaces and with quoted or unquoted values.

    Example::

        text = '<td>More info at the <a href="https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/wiki">pyparsing</a> wiki page</td>'
        # makeHTMLTags returns pyparsing expressions for the opening and
        # closing tags as a 2-tuple
        a,a_end = makeHTMLTags("A")
        link_expr = a + SkipTo(a_end)("link_text") + a_end

        for link in link_expr.searchString(text):
            # attributes in the <A> tag (like "href" shown here) are

    ``FollowedBy`` does *not* advance the parsing position within
    the input string, it only verifies that the specified parse
    expression matches at the current position.  ``FollowedBy``
    always returns a null token list. If any results names are defined
    in the lookahead expression, those *will* be returned for access by
    name.

    Example::

        # use FollowedBy to match a label only if it is followed by a ':'
        data_word = Word(alphas)
        label = data_word + FollowedBy(':')
        attr_expr = Group(label + Suppress(':') + OneOrMore(data_word, stopOn=label).setParseAction(' '.join))

        OneOrMore(attr_expr).parseString("shape: SQUARE color: BLACK posn: upper left").pprint()

    string
    returnStringDOTALLHelper to define a counted list of expressions.

    This helper defines a pattern of the form::

        integer expr expr expr...

    where the leading integer tells how many expr expressions follow.
    The matched tokens returns the array of expr tokens as a list - the
    leading count token is suppressed.

    If ``intExpr`` is specified, it should be a pyparsing expression
    that produces an integer value.

    Example::

        countedArray(Word(alphas)).parseString('2 ab cd ef')  # -> ['ab', 'cd']

        # in this parser, the leading integer value is given in binary,
        # '10' indicating that 2 values are in the array
        binaryConstant = Word('01').setParseAction(lambda t: int(t[0], 2))
        countedArray(Word(alphas), intExpr=binaryConstant).parseString('10 ab cd ef')  # -> ['ab', 'cd']
    Optional repetition of zero or more of the given expression.

    Parameters:
     - expr - expression that must match zero or more times
     - stopOn - (default= ``None``) - expression for a terminating sentinel
          (only required if the sentinel would ordinarily match the repetition
          expression)

    Example: similar to :class:`OneOrMore`
    
        Overrides the default whitespace chars
        Token for matching strings that match a given regular
    expression. Defined with string specifying the regular expression in
    a form recognized by the stdlib Python  `re module <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html>`_.
    If the given regex contains named groups (defined using ``(?P<name>...)``),
    these will be preserved as named parse results.

    Example::

        realnum = Regex(r"[+-]?\d+\.\d*")
        date = Regex(r'(?P<year>\d{4})-(?P<month>\d\d?)-(?P<day>\d\d?)')

        Add a boolean predicate function to expression's list of parse actions. See
        :class:`setParseAction` for function call signatures. Unlike ``setParseAction``,
        functions passed to ``addCondition`` need to return boolean success/fail of the condition.

        Optional keyword arguments:
        - message = define a custom message to be used in the raised exception
        - fatal   = if True, will raise ParseFatalException to stop parsing immediately; otherwise will raise ParseException

    the tokens matched in a previous expression, that is, it looks for
    a 'repeat' of a previous expression.  For example::

        first = Word(nums)
        second = matchPreviousLiteral(first)
        matchExpr = first + ":" + second

    will match ``"1:1"``, but not ``"1:2"``.  Because this
    matches a previous literal, will also match the leading
    ``"1:1"`` in ``"1:10"``. If this is not desired, use
    :class:`matchPreviousExpr`. Do *not* use with packrat parsing
    enabled.
    endlocMarker_-:Token for matching words composed of allowed character sets.
    Defined with string containing all allowed initial characters, an
    optional string containing allowed body characters (if omitted,
    defaults to the initial character set), and an optional minimum,
    maximum, and/or exact length.  The default value for ``min`` is
    1 (a minimum value < 1 is not valid); the default values for
    ``max`` and ``exact`` are 0, meaning no maximum or exact
    length restriction. An optional ``excludeChars`` parameter can
    list characters that might be found in the input ``bodyChars``
    string; useful to define a word of all printables except for one or
    two characters, for instance.

    :class:`srange` is useful for defining custom character set strings
    for defining ``Word`` expressions, using range notation from
    regular expression character sets.

    A common mistake is to use :class:`Word` to match a specific literal
    string, as in ``Word("Address")``. Remember that :class:`Word`
    uses the string argument to define *sets* of matchable characters.
    This expression would match "Add", "AAA", "dAred", or any other word
    made up of the characters 'A', 'd', 'r', 'e', and 's'. To match an
    exact literal string, use :class:`Literal` or :class:`Keyword`.

    pyparsing includes helper strings for building Words:

     - :class:`alphas`
     - :class:`nums`
     - :class:`alphanums`
     - :class:`hexnums`
     - :class:`alphas8bit` (alphabetic characters in ASCII range 128-255
       - accented, tilded, umlauted, etc.)
     - :class:`punc8bit` (non-alphabetic characters in ASCII range
       128-255 - currency, symbols, superscripts, diacriticals, etc.)
     - :class:`printables` (any non-whitespace character)

    Example::

        # a word composed of digits
        integer = Word(nums) # equivalent to Word("0123456789") or Word(srange("0-9"))

        # a word with a leading capital, and zero or more lowercase
        capital_word = Word(alphas.upper(), alphas.lower())

        # hostnames are alphanumeric, with leading alpha, and '-'
        hostname = Word(alphas, alphanums+'-')

        # roman numeral (not a strict parser, accepts invalid mix of characters)
        roman = Word("IVXLCDM")

        # any string of non-whitespace characters, except for ','
        csv_value = Word(printables, excludeChars=",")
    indentedBlock.<locals>.checkPeerIndentConverter to concatenate all matching tokens to a single string.
    By default, the matching patterns must also be contiguous in the
    input string; this can be disabled by specifying
    ``'adjacent=False'`` in the constructor.

    Example::

        real = Word(nums) + '.' + Word(nums)
        print(real.parseString('3.1416')) # -> ['3', '.', '1416']
        # will also erroneously match the following
        print(real.parseString('3. 1416')) # -> ['3', '.', '1416']

        real = Combine(Word(nums) + '.' + Word(nums))
        print(real.parseString('3.1416')) # -> ['3.1416']
        # no match when there are internal spaces
        print(real.parseString('3. 1416')) # -> Exception: Expected W:(0123...)
    _literalStringClassnull string passed to Keyword; use Empty() instead_ParseResults__accumNamesOr.streamline.<locals>.<genexpr>ParserElement.__repr__%s(?:[^%s\n\r%s]A variation on :class:`Literal` which matches "close" matches,
    that is, strings with at most 'n' mismatching characters.
    :class:`CloseMatch` takes parameters:

     - ``match_string`` - string to be matched
     - ``maxMismatches`` - (``default=1``) maximum number of
       mismatches allowed to count as a match

    The results from a successful parse will contain the matched text
    from the input string and the following named results:

     - ``mismatches`` - a list of the positions within the
       match_string where mismatches were found
     - ``original`` - the original match_string used to compare
       against the input string

    If ``mismatches`` is an empty list, then the match was an exact
    match.

    Example::

        patt = CloseMatch("ATCATCGAATGGA")
        patt.parseString("ATCATCGAAXGGA") # -> (['ATCATCGAAXGGA'], {'mismatches': [[9]], 'original': ['ATCATCGAATGGA']})
        patt.parseString("ATCAXCGAAXGGA") # -> Exception: Expected 'ATCATCGAATGGA' (with up to 1 mismatches) (at char 0), (line:1, col:1)

        # exact match
        patt.parseString("ATCATCGAATGGA") # -> (['ATCATCGAATGGA'], {'mismatches': [[]], 'original': ['ATCATCGAATGGA']})

        # close match allowing up to 2 mismatches
        patt = CloseMatch("ATCATCGAATGGA", maxMismatches=2)
        patt.parseString("ATCAXCGAAXGGA") # -> (['ATCAXCGAAXGGA'], {'mismatches': [[4, 9]], 'original': ['ATCATCGAATGGA']})

    Exception thrown when parse expressions don't match class;
    supported attributes by name are:
    - lineno - returns the line number of the exception text
    - col - returns the column number of the exception text
    - line - returns the line containing the exception text

    Example::

        except ParseException as pe:
            print(pe)

    ParseResults.__repr__ParseExpression.streamlineParseResults.__setitem__NotAny.__init__
        Define name for referencing matching tokens as a nested attribute
        of the returned parse results.
        NOTE: this returns a *copy* of the original :class:`ParserElement` object;
        this is so that the client can define a basic element, such as an
        integer, and reference it in multiple places with different names.

        You can also set results names using the abbreviated syntax,
        ``expr("name")`` in place of ``expr.setResultsName("name")``
        - see :class:`__call__`.

        Example::

            date_str = (integer.setResultsName("year") + '/'
                        + integer.setResultsName("month") + '/'
                        + integer.setResultsName("day"))

            # equivalent form:
            date_str = integer("year") + '/' + integer("month") + '/' + integer("day")
        
        Execute the parse expression on the given file or filename.

        Helper to create a parse action for converting parsed date string to Python datetime.date

        Params -
         - fmt - format to be passed to datetime.strptime (default= ``"%Y-%m-%d"``)

        Example::

            date_expr = pyparsing_common.iso8601_date.copy()
            date_expr.setParseAction(pyparsing_common.convertToDate())
            print(date_expr.parseString("1999-12-31"))

        prints::

            [datetime.date(1999, 12, 31)]
        ParserElement.__eq__Lookbehind matching of the given parse expression.
    ``PrecededBy`` does not advance the parsing position within the
    input string, it only verifies that the specified parse expression
    matches prior to the current position.  ``PrecededBy`` always
    returns a null token list, but if a results name is defined on the
    given expression, it is returned.

    Parameters:

     - expr - expression that must match prior to the current parse
       location
     - retreat - (default= ``None``) - (int) maximum number of characters
       to lookbehind prior to the current parse location

    If the lookbehind expression is a string, Literal, Keyword, or
    a Word or CharsNotIn with a specified exact or maximum length, then
    the retreat parameter is not required. Otherwise, retreat must be
    specified to give a maximum number of characters to look back from
    the current parse position for a lookbehind match.

    Example::

        # VB-style variable names with type prefixes
        int_var = PrecededBy("#") + pyparsing_common.identifier
        str_var = PrecededBy("$") + pyparsing_common.identifier

        such name, then returns the given ``defaultValue`` or ``None`` if no
        ``defaultValue`` is specified.

        Similar to ``dict.get()``.

        Example::

            integer = Word(nums)
            date_str = integer("year") + '/' + integer("month") + '/' + integer("day")

            result = date_str.parseString("1999/12/31")
            print(result.get("year")) # -> '1999'
            print(result.get("hour", "not specified")) # -> 'not specified'
            print(result.get("hour")) # -> None
        ParseBaseException._from_exception_ParseResultsWithOffset.__init__FollowedBy.parseImplParserElement._FifoCache.__init__.<locals>.setParserElement.__str__
        Removes and returns item at specified index (default= ``last``).
        Supports both ``list`` and ``dict`` semantics for ``pop()``. If
        passed no argument or an integer argument, it will use ``list``
        semantics and pop tokens from the list of parsed tokens. If passed
        a non-integer argument (most likely a string), it will use ``dict``
        semantics and pop the corresponding value from any defined results
        names. A second default return value argument is supported, just as in
        ``dict.pop()``.

        Example::

            def remove_first(tokens):
                tokens.pop(0)
            print(OneOrMore(Word(nums)).parseString("0 123 321")) # -> ['0', '123', '321']
            print(OneOrMore(Word(nums)).addParseAction(remove_first).parseString("0 123 321")) # -> ['123', '321']

            label = Word(alphas)
            patt = label("LABEL") + OneOrMore(Word(nums))
            print(patt.parseString("AAB 123 321").dump())

            # Use pop() in a parse action to remove named result (note that corresponding value is not
            # removed from list form of results)
            def remove_LABEL(tokens):
                tokens.pop("LABEL")
                return tokens
            patt.addParseAction(remove_LABEL)
            print(patt.parseString("AAB 123 321").dump())

        prints::

            ['AAB', '123', '321']
            - LABEL: AAB

            ['AAB', '123', '321']
        ParseResults.keys
        Scan the input string for expression matches.  Each match will return the
        matching tokens, start location, and end location.  May be called with optional
        ``maxMatches`` argument, to clip scanning after 'n' matches are found.  If
        ``overlap`` is specified, then overlapping matches will be reported.

        Note that the start and end locations are reported relative to the string
        being parsed.  See :class:`parseString` for more information on parsing
        strings with embedded tabs.

        Example::

            source = "sldjf123lsdjjkf345sldkjf879lkjsfd987"
            print(source)
            for tokens,start,end in Word(alphas).scanString(source):
                print(' '*start + '^'*(end-start))
                print(' '*start + tokens[0])

        Combine.postParse_ParseResults__lookupParserElement.__rmul__keepTabsHelper method for constructing grammars of expressions made up of
    operators working in a precedence hierarchy.  Operators may be unary
    or binary, left- or right-associative.  Parse actions can also be
    attached to operator expressions. The generated parser will also
    recognize the use of parentheses to override operator precedences
    (see example below).

    Note: if you define a deep operator list, you may see performance
    issues when using infixNotation. See
    :class:`ParserElement.enablePackrat` for a mechanism to potentially
    improve your parser performance.

    Parameters:
     - baseExpr - expression representing the most basic element for the
       nested
     - opList - list of tuples, one for each operator precedence level
       in the expression grammar; each tuple is of the form ``(opExpr,
       numTerms, rightLeftAssoc, parseAction)``, where:

       - opExpr is the pyparsing expression for the operator; may also
         be a string, which will be converted to a Literal; if numTerms
         is 3, opExpr is a tuple of two expressions, for the two
         operators separating the 3 terms
       - numTerms is the number of terms for this operator (must be 1,
         2, or 3)
       - rightLeftAssoc is the indicator whether the operator is right
         or left associative, using the pyparsing-defined constants
         ``opAssoc.RIGHT`` and ``opAssoc.LEFT``.
       - parseAction is the parse action to be associated with
         expressions matching this operator expression (the parse action
         tuple member may be omitted); if the parse action is passed
         a tuple or list of functions, this is equivalent to calling
         ``setParseAction(*fn)``
         (:class:`ParserElement.setParseAction`)
     - lpar - expression for matching left-parentheses
       (default= ``Suppress('(')``)
     - rpar - expression for matching right-parentheses
       (default= ``Suppress(')')``)

    Example::

        # simple example of four-function arithmetic with ints and
        # variable names
        integer = pyparsing_common.signed_integer
        varname = pyparsing_common.identifier

        arith_expr = infixNotation(integer | varname,
            [
            ('-', 1, opAssoc.RIGHT),
            (oneOf('* /'), 2, opAssoc.LEFT),
            (oneOf('+ -'), 2, opAssoc.LEFT),
            ])

    shares_memory(a, b, max_work=None)

    Determine if two arrays share memory

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : ndarray
        Input arrays
    max_work : int, optional
        Effort to spend on solving the overlap problem (maximum number
        of candidate solutions to consider). The following special
        values are recognized:

        max_work=MAY_SHARE_EXACT  (default)
            The problem is solved exactly. In this case, the function returns
            True only if there is an element shared between the arrays.
        max_work=MAY_SHARE_BOUNDS
            Only the memory bounds of a and b are checked.

    Raises
    ------
    numpy.TooHardError
        Exceeded max_work.

    Returns
    -------
    out : bool

    See Also

    The order of derivation must be integerexpected 1D vector for winvalid array typeexpected 1D or 2D array for yPower is too large
    may_share_memory(a, b, max_work=None)

    Determine if two arrays might share memory

    A return of True does not necessarily mean that the two arrays
    share any element.  It just means that they *might*.

    Only the memory bounds of a and b are checked by default.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : ndarray
        Input arrays
    max_work : int, optional
        Effort to spend on solving the overlap problem.  See
        `shares_memory` for details.  Default for ``may_share_memory``
        is to do a bounds check.

    Returns
    -------
    out : bool

    See Also
    --------
    shares_memory

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.may_share_memory(np.array([1,2]), np.array([5,8,9]))
    False
    >>> x = np.zeros([3, 4])
    >>> np.may_share_memory(x[:,0], x[:,1])
    True

    unpackbits(myarray, axis=None)

    Unpacks elements of a uint8 array into a binary-valued output array.

    Each element of `myarray` represents a bit-field that should be unpacked
    into a binary-valued output array. The shape of the output array is either
    1-D (if `axis` is None) or the same shape as the input array with unpacking
    done along the axis specified.

    Parameters
    ----------
    myarray : ndarray, uint8 type
       Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        The dimension over which bit-unpacking is done.
        ``None`` implies unpacking the flattened array.

    Returns
    -------
    unpacked : ndarray, uint8 type
       The elements are binary-valued (0 or 1).

    See Also
    --------
    packbits : Packs the elements of a binary-valued array into bits in a uint8
               array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[2], [7], [23]], dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> a
    array([[ 2],
           [ 7],
           [23]], dtype=uint8)
    >>> b = np.unpackbits(a, axis=1)
    >>> b
    array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]], dtype=uint8)

    Blit directly from a array values.

    Directly copy values from an array into a Surface. This is faster than
    converting the array into a Surface and blitting. The array must be the
    same dimensions as the Surface and will completely replace all pixel
    values. Only integer, ascii character and record arrays are accepted.

    This function will temporarily lock the Surface as the new values are
    copied.

    Copy an array to a new surface.

    Create a new Surface that best resembles the data and format on the
    array. The array can be 2D or 3D with any sized integer values.
    record array has no attribute %sThe axis must be integer
    putmask(a, mask, values)

    Changes elements of an array based on conditional and input values.

    Sets ``a.flat[n] = values[n]`` for each n where ``mask.flat[n]==True``.

    If `values` is not the same size as `a` and `mask` then it will repeat.
    This gives behavior different from ``a[mask] = values``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Target array.
    mask : array_like
        Boolean mask array. It has to be the same shape as `a`.
    values : array_like
        Values to put into `a` where `mask` is True. If `values` is smaller
        than `a` it will be repeated.

    See Also
    --------

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
    >>> np.putmask(x, x>2, x**2)
    >>> x
    array([[ 0,  1,  2],
           [ 9, 16, 25]])

    If `values` is smaller than `a` it is repeated:

    >>> x = np.arange(5)
    >>> np.putmask(x, x>1, [-33, -44])
    >>> x

    packbits(myarray, axis=None)

    Packs the elements of a binary-valued array into bits in a uint8 array.

    The result is padded to full bytes by inserting zero bits at the end.

    Parameters
    ----------
    myarray : array_like
        An array of integers or booleans whose elements should be packed to
        bits.
    axis : int, optional
        The dimension over which bit-packing is done.
        ``None`` implies packing the flattened array.

    Returns
    -------
    packed : ndarray
        Array of type uint8 whose elements represent bits corresponding to the
        logical (0 or nonzero) value of the input elements. The shape of
        `packed` has the same number of dimensions as the input (unless `axis`
        is None, in which case the output is 1-D).

    See Also
    --------
    unpackbits: Unpacks elements of a uint8 array into a binary-valued output
                array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[[1,0,1],
    ...                [0,1,0]],
    ...               [[1,1,0],
    ...                [0,0,1]]])
    >>> b = np.packbits(a, axis=-1)
    >>> b
    array([[[160],[64]],[[192],[32]]], dtype=uint8)

    Note that in binary 160 = 1010 0000, 64 = 0100 0000, 192 = 1100 0000,
    and 32 = 0010 0000.

    Do any platform-specific customization of a compiler instance.

    This method calls `distutils.sysconfig.customize_compiler` for
    platform-specific customization, as well as optionally remove a flag
    to suppress spurious warnings in case C++ code is being compiled.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dist : object
        This parameter is not used for anything.
    need_cxx : bool, optional
        Whether or not C++ has to be compiled. If so (True), the
        ``"-Wstrict-prototypes"`` option is removed to prevent spurious
        warnings. Default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Notes
    -----
    All the default options used by distutils can be extracted with::

      from distutils import sysconfig
      sysconfig.get_config_vars('CC', 'CXX', 'OPT', 'BASECFLAGS',
                                'CCSHARED', 'LDSHARED', 'SO')

    Simple matching of version numbers, for use in CCompiler and FCompiler.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pat : str, optional
        A regular expression matching version numbers.
        Default is ``r'[-.\d]+'``.
    ignore : str, optional
        A regular expression matching patterns to skip.
        Default is ``''``, in which case nothing is skipped.
    start : str, optional
        A regular expression matching the start of where to start looking
        for version numbers.
        Default is ``''``, in which case searching is started at the
        beginning of the version string given to `matcher`.

    Returns
    -------
    matcher : callable
        A function that is appropriate to use as the ``.version_match``
        attribute of a `CCompiler` class. `matcher` takes a single parameter,
        a version string.

    ok_status : list of int, optional
        The list of status values returned by the version look-up process
        for which a version string is returned. If the status value is not
        in `ok_status`, None is returned. Default is ``[0]``.

    Returns
    -------
    version : str or None
        Version string, in the format of `distutils.version.LooseVersion`.

exec_command

Implements exec_command function that is (almost) equivalent to
commands.getstatusoutput function but on NT, DOS systems the
returned status is actually correct (though, the returned status
values may be different by a factor). In addition, exec_command
takes keyword arguments for (re-)defining environment variables.

Provides functions:

  exec_command  --- execute command in a specified directory and
                    in the modified environment.
  find_executable --- locate a command using info from environment
                    variable PATH. Equivalent to posix `which`
                    command.

    Parameters
    ----------
    is_python_ext : bool, optional
        Whether the shared library is a Python extension.  Default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    so_ext : str
        The shared library extension.

    Notes
    -----
    For Python shared libs, `so_ext` will typically be '.so' on Linux and OS X,
    and '.pyd' on Windows.  For Python >= 3.2 `so_ext` has a tag prepended on
    POSIX systems according to PEP 3149.  For Python 3.2 this is implemented on
    Linux, but not on OS X.

        Recursively add files under data_path to the list of data_files to be
        installed (and distributed). The data_path can be either a relative
        path-name, or an absolute path-name, or a 2-tuple where the first
        argument shows where in the install directory the data directory
        should be installed to.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data_path : seq or str
            Argument can be either

                * 2-sequence (<datadir suffix>, <path to data directory>)
                * path to data directory where python datadir suffix defaults
                  to package dir.

        Notes
        -----
        Rules for installation paths::

            foo/bar -> (foo/bar, foo/bar) -> parent/foo/bar
            (gun, foo/bar) -> parent/gun
            foo/* -> (foo/a, foo/a), (foo/b, foo/b) -> parent/foo/a, parent/foo/b
            (gun, foo/*) -> (gun, foo/a), (gun, foo/b) -> gun
            (gun/*, foo/*) -> parent/gun/a, parent/gun/b
            /foo/bar -> (bar, /foo/bar) -> parent/bar
            (gun, /foo/bar) -> parent/gun
            (fun/*/gun/*, sun/foo/bar) -> parent/fun/foo/gun/bar

        Examples
        --------
        For example suppose the source directory contains fun/foo.dat and
        fun/bar/car.dat:

        >>> self.add_data_dir('fun')                       #doctest: +SKIP
        >>> self.add_data_dir(('sun', 'fun'))              #doctest: +SKIP
        >>> self.add_data_dir(('gun', '/full/path/to/fun'))#doctest: +SKIP

        Will install data-files to the locations::

            <package install directory>/
              fun/
                foo.dat
                bar/
                  car.dat
              sun/
                foo.dat
                bar/
                  car.dat
              gun/
                foo.dat

            Argument(s) can be either

                * 2-sequence (<datadir prefix>,<path to data file(s)>)
                * paths to data files where python datadir prefix defaults
                  to package dir.

        Notes
        -----
        The form of each element of the files sequence is very flexible
        allowing many combinations of where to get the files from the package
        and where they should ultimately be installed on the system. The most
        basic usage is for an element of the files argument sequence to be a
        simple filename. This will cause that file from the local path to be
        installed to the installation path of the self.name package (package
        path). The file argument can also be a relative path in which case the
        entire relative path will be installed into the package directory.
        Finally, the file can be an absolute path name in which case the file
        will be found at the absolute path name but installed to the package
        path.

        This basic behavior can be augmented by passing a 2-tuple in as the
        file argument. The first element of the tuple should specify the
        relative path (under the package install directory) where the
        remaining sequence of files should be installed to (it has nothing to
        do with the file-names in the source distribution). The second element
        of the tuple is the sequence of files that should be installed. The
        files in this sequence can be filenames, relative paths, or absolute
        paths. For absolute paths the file will be installed in the top-level
        package installation directory (regardless of the first argument).
        Filenames and relative path names will be installed in the package
        install directory under the path name given as the first element of
        the tuple.

        Rules for installation paths:

          #. file.txt -> (., file.txt)-> parent/file.txt
          #. foo/file.txt -> (foo, foo/file.txt) -> parent/foo/file.txt
          #. /foo/bar/file.txt -> (., /foo/bar/file.txt) -> parent/file.txt
          #. ``*``.txt -> parent/a.txt, parent/b.txt
          #. foo/``*``.txt`` -> parent/foo/a.txt, parent/foo/b.txt
          #. ``*/*.txt`` -> (``*``, ``*``/``*``.txt) -> parent/c/a.txt, parent/d/b.txt
          #. (sun, file.txt) -> parent/sun/file.txt
          #. (sun, bar/file.txt) -> parent/sun/file.txt
          #. (sun, /foo/bar/file.txt) -> parent/sun/file.txt
          #. (sun, ``*``.txt) -> parent/sun/a.txt, parent/sun/b.txt
          #. (sun, bar/``*``.txt) -> parent/sun/a.txt, parent/sun/b.txt
          #. (sun/``*``, ``*``/``*``.txt) -> parent/sun/c/a.txt, parent/d/b.txt

        An additional feature is that the path to a data-file can actually be
        a function that takes no arguments and returns the actual path(s) to
        the data-files. This is useful when the data files are generated while
        building the package.

        Examples
        --------
        Add files to the list of data_files to be included with the package.

            >>> self.add_data_files('foo.dat',
            ...     ('fun', ['gun.dat', 'nun/pun.dat', '/tmp/sun.dat']),
            ...     'bar/cat.dat',
            ...     '/full/path/to/can.dat')                   #doctest: +SKIP

        will install these data files to::

            <package install directory>/
             foo.dat
             fun/
               gun.dat
               nun/
                 pun.dat
             sun.dat
             bar/
               car.dat
             can.dat

        where <package install directory> is the package (or sub-package)
        directory such as '/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/mypackage' ('C:
        \Python2.4 \Lib \site-packages \mypackage') or
        '/usr/lib/python2.4/site- packages/mypackage/mysubpackage' ('C:
        \Python2.4 \Lib \site-packages \mypackage \mysubpackage').

            source files or None. If None is returned then no sources are
            generated. If the Extension instance has no sources after
            processing all source generators, then no extension module is
            built.

        Similar to add_library, but the specified library is installed.

        Most C libraries used with `distutils` are only used to build python
        extensions, but libraries built through this method will be installed
        so that they can be reused by third-party packages.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str
            Name of the installed library.
        sources : sequence
            List of the library's source files. See `add_library` for details.
        install_dir : str
            Path to install the library, relative to the current sub-package.
        build_info : dict, optional
            The following keys are allowed:

        The best way to encode the options required to link against the specified
        C libraries is to use a "libname.ini" file, and use `get_info` to
        retrieve the required options (see `add_npy_pkg_config` for more

        Generate and install a npy-pkg config file from a template.

        The config file generated from `template` is installed in the
        given install directory, using `subst_dict` for variable substitution.

        Parameters
        ----------
        template : str
            The path of the template, relatively to the current package path.
        install_dir : str
            Where to install the npy-pkg config file, relatively to the current
            package path.
        subst_dict : dict, optional
            If given, any string of the form ``@key@`` will be replaced by
            ``subst_dict[key]`` in the template file when installed. The install
            prefix is always available through the variable ``@prefix@``, since the
            install prefix is not easy to get reliably from setup.py.

        See also
        --------
        add_installed_library, get_info

        Notes
        -----
        This works for both standard installs and in-place builds, i.e. the
        ``@prefix@`` refer to the source directory for in-place builds.

        Examples
        --------
        ::

            config.add_npy_pkg_config('foo.ini.in', 'lib', {'foo': bar})

    Return library info for the given package.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pkgname : str
        Name of the package (should match the name of the .ini file, without
        the extension, e.g. foo for the file foo.ini).
    dirs : sequence, optional
        If given, should be a sequence of additional directories where to look
        for npy-pkg-config files. Those directories are searched prior to the
        NumPy directory.

    Returns
    -------
    pkginfo : class instance
        The `LibraryInfo` instance containing the build information.

    Raises
    ------
    PkgNotFound
        If the package is not found.

    Return an info dict for a given C library.

    The info dict contains the necessary options to use the C library.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pkgname : str
        Name of the package (should match the name of the .ini file, without
        the extension, e.g. foo for the file foo.ini).
    dirs : sequence, optional
        If given, should be a sequence of additional directories where to look
        for npy-pkg-config files. Those directories are searched prior to the
        NumPy directory.

    Returns
    -------
    info : dict
        The dictionary with build information.

    Raises
    ------
    PkgNotFound
        If the package is not found.

    See Also
    --------
    Configuration.add_npy_pkg_config, Configuration.add_installed_library,
    get_pkg_info

    Examples
    --------
    To get the necessary information for the npymath library from NumPy:

    >>> npymath_info = np.distutils.misc_util.get_info('npymath')
    >>> npymath_info                                    #doctest: +SKIP
    {'define_macros': [], 'libraries': ['npymath'], 'library_dirs':
    ['.../numpy/core/lib'], 'include_dirs': ['.../numpy/core/include']}

    This info dict can then be used as input to a `Configuration` instance::

      config.add_extension('foo', sources=['foo.c'], extra_info=npymath_info)

    Return library info for a package from its configuration file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pkgname : str
        Name of the package (should match the name of the .ini file, without
        the extension, e.g. foo for the file foo.ini).
    dirs : sequence, optional
        If given, should be a sequence of directories - usually including
        the NumPy base directory - where to look for npy-pkg-config files.

    Returns
    -------
    pkginfo : class instance
        The `LibraryInfo` instance containing the build information.

    Raises
    ------
    PkgNotFound
        If the package is not found.

    See Also
    --------
    misc_util.get_info, misc_util.get_pkg_info

    Examples
    --------
    >>> npymath_info = np.distutils.npy_pkg_config.read_config('npymath')
    >>> type(npymath_info)
    <class 'numpy.distutils.npy_pkg_config.LibraryInfo'>
    >>> print(npymath_info)

Decorators for labeling and modifying behavior of test objects.

Decorators that merely return a modified version of the original
function object are straightforward. Decorators that return a new
function object need to use
::

  nose.tools.make_decorator(original_function)(decorator)

in returning the decorator, in order to preserve meta-data such as
function name, setup and teardown functions and so on - see
``nose.tools`` for more information.

    Label a test as 'slow'.

    The exact definition of a slow test is obviously both subjective and
    hardware-dependent, but in general any individual test that requires more
    than a second or two should be labeled as slow (the whole suite consists of
    thousands of tests, so even a second is significant).

    Parameters
    ----------
    t : callable
        The test to label as slow.

    Returns
    -------
    t : callable
        The decorated test `t`.

    Examples
    --------
    The `numpy.testing` module includes ``import decorators as dec``.
    A test can be decorated as slow like this::

      from numpy.testing import *

      @dec.slow
      def test_big(self):
          print('Big, slow test')

    Signals to nose that this function is or is not a test.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tf : bool
        If True, specifies that the decorated callable is a test.
        If False, specifies that the decorated callable is not a test.
        Default is True.

    Notes
    -----
    This decorator can't use the nose namespace, because it can be
    called from a non-test module. See also ``istest`` and ``nottest`` in
    ``nose.tools``.

    Examples
    --------
    `setastest` can be used in the following way::

      from numpy.testing import dec

      @dec.setastest(False)
      def func_with_test_in_name(arg1, arg2):
          pass

    Make function raise SkipTest exception if a given condition is true.

    If the condition is a callable, it is used at runtime to dynamically
    make the decision. This is useful for tests that may require costly
    imports, to delay the cost until the test suite is actually executed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    skip_condition : bool or callable
        Flag to determine whether to skip the decorated test.
    msg : str, optional
        Message to give on raising a SkipTest exception. Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    decorator : function
        Decorator which, when applied to a function, causes SkipTest
        to be raised when `skip_condition` is True, and the function
        to be called normally otherwise.

    Notes
    -----
    The decorator itself is decorated with the ``nose.tools.make_decorator``
    function in order to transmit function name, and various other metadata.

    Make function raise KnownFailureException exception if given condition is true.

    If the condition is a callable, it is used at runtime to dynamically

    imports, to delay the cost until the test suite is actually executed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fail_condition : bool or callable
        Flag to determine whether to mark the decorated test as a known
        failure (if True) or not (if False).
    msg : str, optional
        Message to give on raising a KnownFailureException exception.
        Default is None.

    Returns

    Filter deprecation warnings while running the test suite.

    This decorator can be used to filter DeprecationWarning's, to avoid
    printing them during the test suite run, while checking that the test
    actually raises a DeprecationWarning.

    Parameters
    ----------
    conditional : bool or callable, optional
        Flag to determine whether to mark test as deprecated or not. If the
        condition is a callable, it is used at runtime to dynamically make the
        decision. Default is True.

    Returns
    -------
    decorator : function
        The `deprecated` decorator itself.

    Pytest compatibility class. This implements the simplest level of
    pytest.mark.parametrize for use in nose as an aid in making the transition
    to pytest. It achieves that by adding a dummy var parameter and ignoring
    the doc_func parameter of the base class. It does not support variable
    substitution by name, nor does it support nesting or classes. See the
    pytest documentation for usage.

    Run a test module.

    Equivalent to calling ``$ nosetests <argv> <file_to_run>`` from
    the command line

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_to_run : str, optional
        Path to test module, or None.
        By default, run the module from which this function is called.
    argv : list of strings
        Arguments to be passed to the nose test runner. ``argv[0]`` is
        ignored. All command line arguments accepted by ``nosetests``
        will work. If it is the default value None, sys.argv is used.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Examples
    --------
    Adding the following::

        if __name__ == "__main__" :
            run_module_suite(argv=sys.argv)

    at the end of a test module will run the tests when that module is
    called in the python interpreter.

    Alternatively, calling::

    >>> run_module_suite(file_to_run="numpy/tests/test_matlib.py")  # doctest: +SKIP

    from an interpreter will run all the test routine in 'test_matlib.py'.

    Nose test runner.

    This class is made available as numpy.testing.Tester, and a test function
    is typically added to a package's __init__.py like so::

      from numpy.testing import Tester
      test = Tester().test

    Calling this test function finds and runs all tests associated with the
    package and all its sub-packages.

    Attributes
    ----------
    package_path : str
        Full path to the package to test.
    package_name : str
        Name of the package to test.

    Parameters
    ----------
    package : module, str or None, optional
        The package to test. If a string, this should be the full path to
        the package. If None (default), `package` is set to the module from
        which `NoseTester` is initialized.
    raise_warnings : None, str or sequence of warnings, optional
        This specifies which warnings to configure as 'raise' instead
        of being shown once during the test execution.  Valid strings are:

          - "develop" : equals ``(Warning,)``
          - "release" : equals ``()``, don't raise on any warnings.

        Default is "release".
    depth : int, optional
        If `package` is None, then this can be used to initialize from the
        module of the caller of (the caller of (...)) the code that
        initializes `NoseTester`. Default of 0 means the module of the
        immediate caller; higher values are useful for utility routines that
        want to initialize `NoseTester` objects on behalf of other code.

        Run tests for module using nose.

        Parameters
        ----------
        label : {'fast', 'full', '', attribute identifier}, optional
            Identifies the tests to run. This can be a string to pass to
            the nosetests executable with the '-A' option, or one of several
            special values.  Special values are:

            * 'fast' - the default - which corresponds to the ``nosetests -A``
              option of 'not slow'.
            * 'full' - fast (as above) and slow tests as in the
              'no -A' option to nosetests - this is the same as ''.
            * None or '' - run all tests.
            * attribute_identifier - string passed directly to nosetests as '-A'.

        verbose : int, optional
            Verbosity value for test outputs, in the range 1-10. Default is 1.
        extra_argv : list, optional
            List with any extra arguments to pass to nosetests.
        doctests : bool, optional
            If True, run doctests in module. Default is False.
        coverage : bool, optional
            If True, report coverage of NumPy code. Default is False.
            (This requires the
            `coverage module <https://nedbatchelder.com/code/modules/coveragehtml>`_).
        raise_warnings : None, str or sequence of warnings, optional
            This specifies which warnings to configure as 'raise' instead
            of being shown once during the test execution. Valid strings are:

            * "develop" : equals ``(Warning,)``
            * "release" : equals ``()``, do not raise on any warnings.
        timer : bool or int, optional
            Timing of individual tests with ``nose-timer`` (which needs to be
            installed).  If True, time tests and report on all of them.
            If an integer (say ``N``), report timing results for ``N`` slowest
            tests.

        Returns
        -------
        result : object
            Returns the result of running the tests as a
            ``nose.result.TextTestResult`` object.

        Notes
        -----
        Each NumPy module exposes `test` in its namespace to run all tests for it.
        For example, to run all tests for numpy.lib:

        >>> np.lib.test() #doctest: +SKIP

        Examples
        --------
        >>> result = np.lib.test() #doctest: +SKIP
        Running unit tests for numpy.lib
        ...
        Ran 976 tests in 3.933s

        OK

        >>> result.errors #doctest: +SKIP
        []
        >>> result.knownfail #doctest: +SKIP

        Run benchmarks for module using nose.

        Parameters
        ----------
        label : {'fast', 'full', '', attribute identifier}, optional
            Identifies the benchmarks to run. This can be a string to pass to
            the nosetests executable with the '-A' option, or one of several
            special values.  Special values are:

            * 'fast' - the default - which corresponds to the ``nosetests -A``
              option of 'not slow'.
            * 'full' - fast (as above) and slow benchmarks as in the
              'no -A' option to nosetests - this is the same as ''.
            * None or '' - run all tests.
            * attribute_identifier - string passed directly to nosetests as '-A'.

        verbose : int, optional
            Verbosity value for benchmark outputs, in the range 1-10. Default is 1.
        extra_argv : list, optional
            List with any extra arguments to pass to nosetests.

        Returns
        -------
        success : bool
            Returns True if running the benchmarks works, False if an error
            occurred.

        Notes
        -----
        Benchmarks are like tests, but have names starting with "bench" instead
        of "test", and can be found under the "benchmarks" sub-directory of the
        module.

        Each NumPy module exposes `bench` in its namespace to run all benchmarks
        for it.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> success = np.lib.bench() #doctest: +SKIP
        Running benchmarks for numpy.lib
        ...
        using 562341 items:
        unique:
        0.11
        unique1d:
        0.11
        ratio: 1.0
        nUnique: 56230 == 56230
        ...
        OK

        >>> success #doctest: +SKIP

    Raises an AssertionError if two objects are not equal.

    Given two objects (scalars, lists, tuples, dictionaries or numpy arrays),
    check that all elements of these objects are equal. An exception is raised
    at the first conflicting values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    actual : array_like
        The object to check.
    desired : array_like
        The expected object.
    err_msg : str, optional
        The error message to be printed in case of failure.
    verbose : bool, optional
        If True, the conflicting values are appended to the error message.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If actual and desired are not equal.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.testing.assert_equal([4,5], [4,6])

    Test if two objects are equal, and print an error message if test fails.

    The test is performed with ``actual == desired``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    test_string : str
        The message supplied to AssertionError.
    actual : object
        The object to test for equality against `desired`.
    desired : object
        The expected result.

    Examples
    --------

    Raises an AssertionError if two items are not equal up to desired
    precision.

    .. note:: It is recommended to use one of `assert_allclose`,
              `assert_array_almost_equal_nulp` or `assert_array_max_ulp`
              instead of this function for more consistent floating point
              comparisons.

    The test verifies that the elements of ``actual`` and ``desired`` satisfy.

        ``abs(desired-actual) < 1.5 * 10**(-decimal)``

    That is a looser test than originally documented, but agrees with what the
    actual implementation in `assert_array_almost_equal` did up to rounding
    vagaries. An exception is raised at conflicting values. For ndarrays this
    delegates to assert_array_almost_equal

    Parameters
    ----------
    actual : array_like
        The object to check.
    desired : array_like
        The expected object.
    decimal : int, optional
        Desired precision, default is 7.
    err_msg : str, optional
        The error message to be printed in case of failure.
    verbose : bool, optional
        If True, the conflicting values are appended to the error message.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
      If actual and desired are not equal up to specified precision.

    See Also
    --------
    assert_allclose: Compare two array_like objects for equality with desired
                     relative and/or absolute precision.
    assert_array_almost_equal_nulp, assert_array_max_ulp, assert_equal

    Raises an AssertionError if two items are not equal up to significant
    digits.

    .. note:: It is recommended to use one of `assert_allclose`,
              `assert_array_almost_equal_nulp` or `assert_array_max_ulp`
              instead of this function for more consistent floating point
              comparisons.

    Given two numbers, check that they are approximately equal.
    Approximately equal is defined as the number of significant digits
    that agree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    actual : scalar
        The object to check.
    desired : scalar
        The expected object.
    significant : int, optional
        Desired precision, default is 7.
    err_msg : str, optional
        The error message to be printed in case of failure.
    verbose : bool, optional
        If True, the conflicting values are appended to the error message.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
      If actual and desired are not equal up to specified precision.

    Raises an AssertionError if two array_like objects are not equal.

    Given two array_like objects, check that the shape is equal and all
    elements of these objects are equal. An exception is raised at
    shape mismatch or conflicting values. In contrast to the standard usage
    in numpy, NaNs are compared like numbers, no assertion is raised if
    both objects have NaNs in the same positions.

    The usual caution for verifying equality with floating point numbers is
    advised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The actual object to check.
    y : array_like
        The desired, expected object.
    err_msg : str, optional
        The error message to be printed in case of failure.
    verbose : bool, optional
        If True, the conflicting values are appended to the error message.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If actual and desired objects are not equal.

    See Also
    --------
    assert_allclose: Compare two array_like objects for equality with desired
                     relative and/or absolute precision.
    assert_array_almost_equal_nulp, assert_array_max_ulp, assert_equal

    Examples
    --------
    The first assert does not raise an exception:

    >>> np.testing.assert_array_equal([1.0,2.33333,np.nan],
    ...                               [np.exp(0),2.33333, np.nan])

    Assert fails with numerical inprecision with floats:

    >>> np.testing.assert_array_equal([1.0,np.pi,np.nan],
    ...                               [1, np.sqrt(np.pi)**2, np.nan])
    Traceback (most recent call last):

     y: array([1.      , 3.141593,      nan])

    Use `assert_allclose` or one of the nulp (number of floating point values)
    functions for these cases instead:

    >>> np.testing.assert_allclose([1.0,np.pi,np.nan],
    ...                            [1, np.sqrt(np.pi)**2, np.nan],

    Raises an AssertionError if two objects are not equal up to desired
    precision.

    .. note:: It is recommended to use one of `assert_allclose`,
              `assert_array_almost_equal_nulp` or `assert_array_max_ulp`
              instead of this function for more consistent floating point
              comparisons.

    The test verifies identical shapes and that the elements of ``actual`` and
    ``desired`` satisfy.

        ``abs(desired-actual) < 1.5 * 10**(-decimal)``

    That is a looser test than originally documented, but agrees with what the
    actual implementation did up to rounding vagaries. An exception is raised
    at shape mismatch or conflicting values. In contrast to the standard usage
    in numpy, NaNs are compared like numbers, no assertion is raised if both
    objects have NaNs in the same positions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The actual object to check.
    y : array_like
        The desired, expected object.
    decimal : int, optional
        Desired precision, default is 6.
    err_msg : str, optional
      The error message to be printed in case of failure.
    verbose : bool, optional
        If True, the conflicting values are appended to the error message.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If actual and desired are not equal up to specified precision.

    Raises an AssertionError if two array_like objects are not ordered by less
    than.

    Given two array_like objects, check that the shape is equal and all
    elements of the first object are strictly smaller than those of the
    second object. An exception is raised at shape mismatch or incorrectly
    ordered values. Shape mismatch does not raise if an object has zero
    dimension. In contrast to the standard usage in numpy, NaNs are
    compared, no assertion is raised if both objects have NaNs in the same
    positions.



    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
      The smaller object to check.
    y : array_like
      The larger object to compare.
    err_msg : string
      The error message to be printed in case of failure.
    verbose : bool
        If True, the conflicting values are appended to the error message.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
      If actual and desired objects are not equal.

    Test if two strings are equal.

    If the given strings are equal, `assert_string_equal` does nothing.
    If they are not equal, an AssertionError is raised, and the diff
    between the strings is shown.

    Parameters
    ----------
    actual : str
        The string to test for equality against the expected string.
    desired : str
        The expected string.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.testing.assert_string_equal('abc', 'abc')
    >>> np.testing.assert_string_equal('abc', 'abcd')

    Run doctests found in the given file.

    By default `rundocs` raises an AssertionError on failure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        The path to the file for which the doctests are run.
    raise_on_error : bool
        Whether to raise an AssertionError when a doctest fails. Default is
        True.

    Notes
    -----
    The doctests can be run by the user/developer by adding the ``doctests``
    argument to the ``test()`` call. For example, to run all tests (including
    doctests) for `numpy.lib`:

    >>> np.lib.test(doctests=True)  # doctest: +SKIP

    The decorated test function must raise one of the passed exceptions to
    pass.  If you want to test many assertions about exceptions in a single
    test, you may want to use `assert_raises` instead.

    .. warning::
       This decorator is nose specific, do not use it if you are using a
       different test framework.

    Parameters
    ----------
    args : exceptions
        The test passes if any of the passed exceptions is raised.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError

    Examples
    --------

    Usage::

        @raises(TypeError, ValueError)
        def test_raises_type_error():
            raise TypeError("This test passes")

        @raises(Exception)

    assert_raises(exception_class, callable, *args, **kwargs)
    assert_raises(exception_class)

    Fail unless an exception of class exception_class is thrown
    by callable when invoked with arguments args and keyword
    arguments kwargs. If a different type of exception is
    thrown, it will not be caught, and the test case will be
    deemed to have suffered an error, exactly as for an
    unexpected exception.

    Alternatively, `assert_raises` can be used as a context manager:

    >>> from numpy.testing import assert_raises
    >>> with assert_raises(ZeroDivisionError):
    ...     1 / 0

    is equivalent to

    >>> def div(x, y):

    args and keyword arguments kwargs.

    Alternatively, can be used as a context manager like `assert_raises`.

    Name of this function adheres to Python 3.2+ reference, but should work in
    all versions down to 2.6.

    Apply a decorator to all methods in a class matching a regular expression.

    The given decorator is applied to all public methods of `cls` that are
    matched by the regular expression `testmatch`
    (``testmatch.search(methodname)``). Methods that are private, i.e. start
    with an underscore, are ignored.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : class
        Class whose methods to decorate.
    decorator : function
        Decorator to apply to methods
    testmatch : compiled regexp or str, optional
        The regular expression. Default value is None, in which case the
        nose default (``re.compile(r'(?:^|[\b_\.%s-])[Tt]est' % os.sep)``)
        is used.
        If `testmatch` is a string, it is compiled to a regular expression
        first.

    Return elapsed time for executing code in the namespace of the caller.

    The supplied code string is compiled with the Python builtin ``compile``.
    The precision of the timing is 10 milli-seconds. If the code will execute
    fast on this timescale, it can be executed many times to get reasonable
    timing accuracy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    code_str : str
        The code to be timed.
    times : int, optional
        The number of times the code is executed. Default is 1. The code is
        only compiled once.
    label : str, optional
        A label to identify `code_str` with. This is passed into ``compile``
        as the second argument (for run-time error messages).

    Returns
    -------
    elapsed : float
        Total elapsed time in seconds for executing `code_str` `times` times.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> times = 10
    >>> etime = np.testing.measure('for i in range(1000): np.sqrt(i**2)', times=times)
    >>> print("Time for a single execution : ", etime / times, "s")  # doctest: +SKIP

    Raises an AssertionError if two objects are not equal up to desired
    tolerance.

    The test is equivalent to ``allclose(actual, desired, rtol, atol)``.
    It compares the difference between `actual` and `desired` to
    ``atol + rtol * abs(desired)``.

    .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    actual : array_like
        Array obtained.
    desired : array_like
        Array desired.
    rtol : float, optional
        Relative tolerance.
    atol : float, optional
        Absolute tolerance.
    equal_nan : bool, optional.
        If True, NaNs will compare equal.
    err_msg : str, optional
        The error message to be printed in case of failure.
    verbose : bool, optional
        If True, the conflicting values are appended to the error message.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If actual and desired are not equal up to specified precision.

    See Also
    --------

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = [1e-5, 1e-3, 1e-1]

    Compare two arrays relatively to their spacing.

    This is a relatively robust method to compare two arrays whose amplitude
    is variable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        Input arrays.
    nulp : int, optional
        The maximum number of unit in the last place for tolerance (see Notes).
        Default is 1.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If the spacing between `x` and `y` for one or more elements is larger
        than `nulp`.

    See Also
    --------
    assert_array_max_ulp : Check that all items of arrays differ in at most
        N Units in the Last Place.
    spacing : Return the distance between x and the nearest adjacent number.

    Notes
    -----
    An assertion is raised if the following condition is not met::

        abs(x - y) <= nulps * spacing(maximum(abs(x), abs(y)))

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1., 1e-10, 1e-20])
    >>> eps = np.finfo(x.dtype).eps
    >>> np.testing.assert_array_almost_equal_nulp(x, x*eps/2 + x)

    >>> np.testing.assert_array_almost_equal_nulp(x, x*eps + x)

    Warnings can be slippery, because, whenever a warning is triggered, Python
    adds a ``__warningregistry__`` member to the *calling* module.  This makes
    it impossible to retrigger the warning in this module, whatever you put in
    the warnings filters.  This context manager accepts a sequence of `modules`
    as a keyword argument to its constructor and:

    * stores and removes any ``__warningregistry__`` entries in given `modules`
      on entry;
    * resets ``__warningregistry__`` to its previous state on exit.

    This makes it possible to trigger any warning afresh inside the context
    manager without disturbing the state of warnings outside.

    For compatibility with Python 3.0, please consider all arguments to be
    keyword-only.

    Parameters
    ----------
    record : bool, optional
        Specifies whether warnings should be captured by a custom
        implementation of ``warnings.showwarning()`` and be appended to a list
        returned by the context manager. Otherwise None is returned by the
        context manager. The objects appended to the list are arguments whose
        attributes mirror the arguments to ``showwarning()``.
    modules : sequence, optional
        Sequence of modules for which to reset warnings registry on entry and
        restore on exit. To work correctly, all 'ignore' filters should
        filter by one of these modules.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import warnings
    >>> with np.testing.clear_and_catch_warnings(
    ...         modules=[np.core.fromnumeric]):
    ...     warnings.simplefilter('always')
    ...     warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', module='np.core.fromnumeric')
    ...     # do something that raises a warning but ignore those in
    ...     # np.core.fromnumeric

    Context manager and decorator doing much the same as
    ``warnings.catch_warnings``.

    However, it also provides a filter mechanism to work around
    https://bugs.python.org/issue4180.

    This bug causes Python before 3.4 to not reliably show warnings again
    after they have been ignored once (even within catch_warnings). It
    means that no "ignore" filter can be used easily, since following
    tests might need to see the warning. Additionally it allows easier
    specificity for testing warnings and can be nested.

    Parameters
    ----------
    forwarding_rule : str, optional
        One of "always", "once", "module", or "location". Analogous to
        the usual warnings module filter mode, it is useful to reduce
        noise mostly on the outmost level. Unsuppressed and unrecorded
        warnings will be forwarded based on this rule. Defaults to "always".
        "location" is equivalent to the warnings "default", match by exact
        location the warning warning originated from.

    Notes
    -----
    Filters added inside the context manager will be discarded again
    when leaving it. Upon entering all filters defined outside a
    context will be applied automatically.

    When a recording filter is added, matching warnings are stored in the
    ``log`` attribute as well as in the list returned by ``record``.

    If filters are added and the ``module`` keyword is given, the
    warning registry of this module will additionally be cleared when
    applying it, entering the context, or exiting it. This could cause
    warnings to appear a second time after leaving the context if they
    were configured to be printed once (default) and were already
    printed before the context was entered.

    Nesting this context manager will work as expected when the
    forwarding rule is "always" (default). Unfiltered and unrecorded
    warnings will be passed out and be matched by the outer level.
    On the outmost level they will be printed (or caught by another
    warnings context). The forwarding rule argument can modify this
    behaviour.

    Like ``catch_warnings`` this context manager is not threadsafe.

    Examples
    --------

    With a context manager::

        with np.testing.suppress_warnings() as sup:
            sup.filter(DeprecationWarning, "Some text")
            sup.filter(module=np.ma.core)
            log = sup.record(FutureWarning, "Does this occur?")
            command_giving_warnings()
            # The FutureWarning was given once, the filtered warnings were
            # ignored. All other warnings abide outside settings (may be
            # printed/error)
            assert_(len(log) == 1)
            assert_(len(sup.log) == 1)  # also stored in log attribute

    Or as a decorator::

        sup = np.testing.suppress_warnings()
        sup.filter(module=np.ma.core)  # module must match exactly
        @sup
        def some_function():
            # do something which causes a warning in np.ma.core
            pass

    Fail if the given callable produces any reference cycles.

    If called with all arguments omitted, may be used as a context manager:

        with assert_no_gc_cycles():
            do_something()

    .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        The callable to test.
    \*args : Arguments
        Arguments passed to `func`.
    \*\*kwargs : Kwargs
        Keyword arguments passed to `func`.

    Returns
    -------
    Nothing. The result is deliberately discarded to ensure that all cycles
    are found.

Package resource API
--------------------

A resource is a logical file contained within a package, or a logical
subdirectory thereof.  The package resource API expects resource names
to have their path parts separated with ``/``, *not* whatever the local
path separator is.  Do not use os.path operations to manipulate resource
names being passed into the API.

The package resource API is designed to work with normal filesystem packages,
.egg files, and unpacked .egg files.  It can also work in a limited way with
.zip files and with custom PEP 302 loaders that support the ``get_data()``
method.

r\   Y nX | S )aZ  Return this platform's maximum compatible version.

    distutils.util.get_platform() normally reports the minimum version
    of Mac OS X that would be required to *use* extensions produced by
    distutils.  But what we want when checking compatibility is to know the
    version of Mac OS X that we are *running*.  To allow usage of packages that
    explicitly require a newer version of Mac OS X, we must also know the
    current version of the OS.

    If this condition occurs for any other platform with a version in its
    platform strings, this function should be extended accordingly.

        `requirements` must be a sequence of ``Requirement`` objects.  `env`,
        if supplied, should be an ``Environment`` instance.  If
        not supplied, it defaults to all distributions available within any
        entry or distribution in the working set.  `installer`, if supplied,
        will be invoked with each requirement that cannot be met by an
        already-installed distribution; it should return a ``Distribution`` or
        ``None``.

        Unless `replace_conflicting=True`, raises a VersionConflict exception
        if
        any requirements are found on the path that have the correct name but
        the wrong version.  Otherwise, if an `installer` is supplied it will be
        invoked to obtain the correct version of the requirement and activate
        it.

        `extras` is a list of the extras to be used with these requirements.
        This is important because extra requirements may look like `my_req;
        extra = "my_extra"`, which would otherwise be interpreted as a purely
        optional requirement.  Instead, we want to be able to assert that these
        requirements are truly required.

        Example usage::

            distributions, errors = working_set.find_plugins(
                Environment(plugin_dirlist)
            )
            # add plugins+libs to sys.path
            map(working_set.add, distributions)
            # display errors
            print('Could not load', errors)

        The `plugin_env` should be an ``Environment`` instance that contains
        only distributions that are in the project's "plugin directory" or
        directories. The `full_env`, if supplied, should be an ``Environment``
        contains all currently-available distributions.  If `full_env` is not
        supplied, one is created automatically from the ``WorkingSet`` this
        method is called on, which will typically mean that every directory on
        ``sys.path`` will be scanned for distributions.

        `installer` is a standard installer callback as used by the
        ``resolve()`` method. The `fallback` flag indicates whether we should
        attempt to resolve older versions of a plugin if the newest version
        cannot be resolved.

        This method returns a 2-tuple: (`distributions`, `error_info`), where
        `distributions` is a list of the distributions found in `plugin_env`
        that were loadable, along with any other distributions that are needed
        to resolve their dependencies.  `error_info` is a dictionary mapping
        unloadable plugin distributions to an exception instance describing the
        error that occurred. Usually this will be a ``DistributionNotFound`` or
        ``VersionConflict`` instance.

        If the default extraction path is overridden and set to an insecure

        This is where Mac header rewrites should be done; other platforms don't

        Resource providers should call this method ONLY after successfully
        extracting a compressed resource.  They must NOT call it on resources
        that are already in the filesystem.

        `tempname` is the current (temporary) name of the file, and `filename`
        is the name it will be renamed to by the caller after this routine
        returns.

        If you do not call this routine before any extractions take place, the
        path defaults to the return value of ``get_default_cache()``.  (Which
        is based on the ``PYTHON_EGG_CACHE`` environment variable, with various
        platform-specific fallbacks.  See that routine's documentation for more
        details.)

        Resources are extracted to subdirectories of this path based upon
        information given by the ``IResourceProvider``.  You may set this to a
        temporary directory, but then you must call ``cleanup_resources()`` to
        delete the extracted files when done.  There is no guarantee that
        ``cleanup_resources()`` will be able to remove all extracted files.

        (Note: you may not change the extraction path for a given resource
        manager once resources have been extracted, unless you first call
        ``cleanup_resources()``.)

        Delete all extracted resource files and directories, returning a list
        of the file and directory names that could not be successfully removed.
        This function does not have any concurrency protection, so it should
        generally only be called when the extraction path is a temporary
        directory exclusive to a single process.  This method is not
        automatically called; you must call it explicitly or register it as an
        ``atexit`` function if you wish to ensure cleanup of a temporary
        directory used for extractions.

        def namespace_handler(importer, path_entry, moduleName, module):

    Namespace handlers are only called if the importer object has already

    Contrary to POSIX 2008, on Cygwin, getcwd (3) contains
    symlink components. Using

    would probably better, in Cygwin even more so, except
    that this seems to be by design...

        Packages installed by distutils (e.g. numpy or scipy),
        which uses an old safe_version, and so
        their version numbers can get mangled when
        converted to filenames (e.g., 1.11.0.dev0+2329eae to
        1.11.0.dev0_2329eae). These distributions will not be
        parsed properly
        downstream by Distribution and safe_version, so
        take an extra step and try to get the version number from
        the metadata file itself instead of the filename.
